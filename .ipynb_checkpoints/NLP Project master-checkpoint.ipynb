       "      <td>Recent events highlight how emerging and re-emerging pathogens are actually becoming global challenges for public health. [1] Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses which are broadly distributed either in humans or in a vast majority of other mammals and birds. These viruses have the possibility to cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. [2, 3] Coronaviruses are highly prevalent in many species. They have a large genetic diversity. Given their RNA, they are susceptible to frequent recombination and mutations of their genomes. In context in which there are increasing human-animal interactions, novel coronaviruses are very likely to emerge periodically. If the newly created cross-species pathogens acquires the ability to infect humans or to be transmitted human to human it can lead to occasional spillover events and epidemics. [4, 5, 6] In the past years two other strains of Coronavirus -severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -have emerged as potential public health worldwide threats. [5] SARS-CoV was the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China; [7, 8, 9] MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East. [10] On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City, located in the Hubei Province, China, associated with exposures in a seafood and wet wholesale market in the same city. A new type of coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020. [11] On 30 January 2020 WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). [12] This novel coronavirus suddenly turned out to be a global health concern for a disease, called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), [13] which was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. [14] Starting from the second-half of January 2020, scientific literature has been particularly focused on the description of this new viral outbreak; the main topics addressed were the epidemiological, clinical and virological aspects as well as the possible public health choices necessary to contain the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, several aspects are still unclear and have not been thoroughly explored, leaving grey areas in our knowledge of the disease and of the outbreak. The aim of this paper is to perform a bibliometric analysis on the first papers published in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, in order to give a glimpse to the researchers of \"who published what\" at the very beginning of this Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\\nWe searched MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database in order to find all relevant studies. After a preliminary search starting from 1 December 2019, we found out that the first article meeting our inclusion criteria was published on 14 January 2020. [15] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 1] We subsequently extended our research to the first 30 days after this milestone article, up to 13 January 2020. We decided to scan the reference lists of the reviews retrieved in order to find potential additional pertinent articles, and to test string sensitivity. The search string used was: coronavirus* OR Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology OR COVID-19 OR nCoV. The virus name was updated from \"2019-nCoV\" to \"SARS-CoV-2\" by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, [16] yet we performed the search using the term \"nCoV\" since we presumed that no paper published between 11 February 2020 and 13 February 2020 would have used the term \"SARS-COV-2\". To achieve the highest sensitivity, we decided to use only a combination of keywords avoiding Mesh terms. Asterisks are used to truncate words, so that every ending after the asterisks was searched. We placed a language restriction for English, without other limits to the search.\\nThe papers were than classified on the basis of a standardized list of key information including: Digital Object Identifier number (DOI), title, journal name, day of first publication (online or paper form), country of the first author affiliation, article type, source of the data and topics addressed. The topics addressed were identified according to 8 categories: generic discussion, epidemiology, virology, pathology and clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapy, transmission, preparedness. Articles that addressed more than a topic in an extensive way were accounted for more than one of the 8 topic categories; the papers that could not be classified in any of the 8 chosen topic categories were classified in the \"Other\" topic category. Eight of us (FS, EA, EB, EB, FE, FM, FS, SS) independently screened all identified articles. Procedure was carried out through title and abstract scanning in order to verify the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus between the reviewers. If disagreement persisted, another reviewer (DG) was called as tie-breaker.\\nThe \"Number Needed to Read\" (NNR) is defined as the ratio of the number of retrieved abstracts to the number of the ones which are pertinent for the research purpose. [17] We calculated the NNR to identify the proportion of papers which were not editorials and commentaries, as well as the proportion of papers with directly collected data. Chi2 test was used in order to test for significant differences in the comparison of percentages, using the statistical software STATA 15 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC).\\nA total of 442 papers were retrieved; 234 articles were found to be pertinent (see Figure 1 ) and read in extenso in order to define their main characteristics. The affiliation of the first authors was distributed among 36 countries: 36.3% of the papers (85 out of 234) had a first author with a Chinese affiliation, 18.4% and 13.7% (43 out of 234 and 32 out of 234) had a first author with an affiliation from UK and USA respectively, while first authors affiliation from Canada accounted for 3.8% of the total (9 out of 234), from Italy for 3% (7 out of 234), and from Australia and Korea both accounted for 2.1% (5 out of 234 each). All the other countries accounted for less than 2% of the first author affiliations (less than 5 out of 234). 63.7% of the papers (149 out of 234) were editorials, commentaries or letters (mainly reported data). 10.7% of the papers (25 out of 234) were secondary papers, mainly narrative reviews, which collected the knowledge available up to that point on some specific topics (i.e. genomics of the virus, transmissibility, etc.). The remaining 25.6% (60 out of 234) were original primary studies: among these, case reports accounted for 43.3% of the total, while in vitro or in vivo studies or genomic studies accounted for 21.7% of the total. The remaining primary studies were cohort studies, case control studies and surveys. Chinese first authors published more original data and primary studies than authors from the UK and the USA (32.9% vs 4.7% of the UK and 6.3% of the USA; p&lt;0.001), who published mostly editorials and commentaries. Of note, 61.5% of the analysed papers used reported/non original data and 15.8% used official data. Conversely, only 17.5% of the papers used data which were directly collected on the field. In 5.2% of the papers the source of the data was not clearly specified. The supplementary materials (Table 1) , available online, report all the findings of this review with the reference and description of the 234 papers selected for the bibliometric analysis.\\nAll rights reserved.

The second most frequent topic was \"Preparedness\" (23.1%): 83.3% of these papers consisted of commentaries, and only 1 paper was a primary study. The \"Epidemiology\" topic was addressed in 15.4% of the papers, and only 2 (5.6%) were primary studies. The lack of primary studies could be observed also for the \"Virology\" topic (14.1%) and the \"Transmission\" topic (12.8%), with only 12 (36.4%) and 6 (20%) papers reporting original data, respectively. On the other hand, the \"Pathology and clinical characteristics\" topic (12.8%) consisted mostly of primary studies (22, 73.3%). \"Therapy\" topic was addressed in 12% of the papers, with 9 papers (33.3%) being primary studies. The least addressed topic was \"Diagnosis\" (9.4%), with 12 papers (54.5%) reporting original data. Finally, 3% of the papers were classified in the \"Other\" topic category. Table 1 , ID: 218] assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection in specialised laboratories into the European Union/European Economic Area countries. This paper emphasized the need for countries to put in place strong measures in order to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early. It was also highlighted the need to perform molecular testing (RT-PCR, as also indicated by the WHO [19] ) on different specimens including: nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, (endo) tracheal aspirate and nasal wash. The communication report also underlined the need for a clinical validation of the test specificity and sensitivity. If nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended types of specimen for diagnostic testing an interesting brief report published by Chinese authors [20] [Supplementary materials 165, 167, 197, 222] were published in the second half of the time frame selected, mostly by authors with a Chinese affiliation. These papers addressed several aspects of COVID-19 treatment, such as interferon inhalation, use of and efficacy of antiviral drugs, potential repurposing treatments with angiotensin receptor blockers, use of antibiotics for bacterial co-infections, and respiratory support therapy (e.g. oxygen saturation, CPAP, invasive mechanical ventilation). Interestingly, one paper published on 4 February 2020 [21] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 91] investigated the possibility that the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect lung cells might be ACE2, a cell-surface protein on lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells; one of the known regulators of endocytosis for the AT2 cells is the AP2associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). The authors suggested the possibility to use high-affinity AAK1-binding drugs to inhibit endocytosis of AT2 cells, such as baricitinib (an oral, targeted All rights reserved.

The mean chance to read papers with directly collected data increased, with the NNR passing from 6.5 in January to 5.4 in February.\\nThe novel coronavirus infection that emerged two months ago (as already discussed, the new coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020) places emphasis on the importance of ensuring that health professionals, researchers and the public have the best possible scientific information.\\nBibliometrics is a scientific method widely used in many fields for quantifying and analysing published information. [22] This kind of literature analysis in the first month after the first publication in Pubmed shows a great number of papers published as expected, mainly by authors with a Chinese affiliation, followed by authors with an UK or USA affiliation. The reason for this distribution is ascribed to the fact that China is the country where the virus was originally isolated and the first one with a COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, we have to point out that, as shown in a commentary published in Nature, in recent years China produced more science PhD than any other country in the world and the Chinese government has been assuming a leading role in supporting its own scientific research.\\n[23] Therefore the research and publication response to the outbreak has been prompt and lively, giving to the scientific community many elements for understanding the new infection. The second country with the highest number of publications was the UK, followed by the USA, probably due to the fact they are the most prolific countries for scientific research. Authors from the UK and the USA wrote mostly editorials and commentaries.\\nThe publication policies of many of the most important scientific journals were adapted to quickly review and publish scientific papers on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. This strategy facilitated the spread of new knowledge on the new infection and on the outbreak. Hence, it is important to have scientific shared papers in order to reduce misinformation which is itself a public health threat. [24] In the early scientific literature we analysed there is a lack of primary studies with original data, as expected, given the very short period of time considered after the first pertinent publication on the new infection. Nevertheless, editorials, news and commentaries are important to share opinions and the viewpoint of an expert or a panel of experts, rather than on producing new scientific evidence.\\nthe variety and severity of the presentation of COVID-19. Further publication and reviews on this topic are needed to summarize the knowledge arising from all the case reports. Diagnostic tools, except for CT scan, were poorly represented and discussed, especially in terms of molecular diagnosis and standardization of the techniques. The \"Therapy\" topic was also poorly represented, since more time is needed for clinical intervention studies.\\nAnalyzing the selected time frame, the percentage of the editorials, news and commentaries has decreased. This was highlighted particularly by our analysis, which shows that from the second half of January to the first half of February the proportion of editorials and commentaries lowered the NNR, thus indicating an increase in the level of evidence produced as well as the increase of primary data availability.\\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, we based our research only on PubMed, that does not index all of the scientific impacted journals. It is strongly recommended to consult more than one relevant database when performing systematic reviews of the literature, [25] even though it has been reported that most of the high-quality articles, like those included in Cochrane Reviews, are indexed in PubMed. [26] In addition, we excluded all the publications not in English. We acknowledge that, given the outbreak started in China, this may have led to a partial selection bias. Nevertheless, papers excluded which were written in Chinese and had an English abstract, were for the greatest part reports of the Chinese Government (data not shown). We considered only the articles published until 13 February 2020, and taking into account that literature is now changing day-by-day for this topic, extending the bibliometric research for the next months would be of paramount importance.\\nIn conclusion, as far as we know, our very early review is the first bibliometric study analyzing the early scientific research output about COVID-19 from a quantitative and descriptive standpoint. Due to the huge amount of interest and concern related to this outbreak, our analysis shows that the scientific publication has been very reactive but still preliminar, with an expected deficit of original data and an excess of editorials and commentaries. Further research is needed to review and synthesize the growing knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, with a special aim on the most important knowledge gaps in terms of diagnosis and effective preventive and therapeutic measures.\\nAll authors declare no support from any organisation for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\"\\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\\nThe authors declare that all the data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information in Supplementary author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 25.20043315 doi: medRxiv preprint   -R  e  g  a  r  d  i  n  g  \"  J  o  u  r  n  a  l  P  u  b  l  i  c  a  t  i  o  n  D  a  t  e  \"  ,  s  o  m  e  d  a  t  e  s  m  a  y  b  e  c  o  n  s  e  c  u  t  i  v  e  t  o  1  3  F  e  b  r  u  a  r  y   2  0  2  0  ;  t  h  i  s  i  s  d  u  e  t  o  t  h  e  f  a  c  t  t  h  a  t  s  o  m  e  p  a  p  e  r  w  e  r  e  a  l  r  e  a  d  y  i  n  d  e  x  e  d  i  n  M  E  D  L  I  N  E  d  a  t  a  b  a  s  e   (  P  u  b  M  e  d  )  a  t  t  h  e  m  o  m  e  n  t  w  e  p  e  r  f  o  r  m  e  d  o  u  r  s  e  a  r  c author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 25.20043315 doi: medRxiv preprint \\n</td>\n",

       "12  Recent events highlight how emerging and re-emerging pathogens are actually becoming global challenges for public health. [1] Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses which are broadly distributed either in humans or in a vast majority of other mammals and birds. These viruses have the possibility to cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. [2, 3] Coronaviruses are highly prevalent in many species. They have a large genetic diversity. Given their RNA, they are susceptible to frequent recombination and mutations of their genomes. In context in which there are increasing human-animal interactions, novel coronaviruses are very likely to emerge periodically. If the newly created cross-species pathogens acquires the ability to infect humans or to be transmitted human to human it can lead to occasional spillover events and epidemics. [4, 5, 6] In the past years two other strains of Coronavirus -severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -have emerged as potential public health worldwide threats. [5] SARS-CoV was the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China; [7, 8, 9] MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East. [10] On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City, located in the Hubei Province, China, associated with exposures in a seafood and wet wholesale market in the same city. A new type of coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020. [11] On 30 January 2020 WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). [12] This novel coronavirus suddenly turned out to be a global health concern for a disease, called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), [13] which was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. [14] Starting from the second-half of January 2020, scientific literature has been particularly focused on the description of this new viral outbreak; the main topics addressed were the epidemiological, clinical and virological aspects as well as the possible public health choices necessary to contain the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, several aspects are still unclear and have not been thoroughly explored, leaving grey areas in our knowledge of the disease and of the outbreak. The aim of this paper is to perform a bibliometric analysis on the first papers published in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, in order to give a glimpse to the researchers of \"who published what\" at the very beginning of this Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\\nWe searched MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database in order to find all relevant studies. After a preliminary search starting from 1 December 2019, we found out that the first article meeting our inclusion criteria was published on 14 January 2020. [15] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 1] We subsequently extended our research to the first 30 days after this milestone article, up to 13 January 2020. We decided to scan the reference lists of the reviews retrieved in order to find potential additional pertinent articles, and to test string sensitivity. The search string used was: coronavirus* OR Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology OR COVID-19 OR nCoV. The virus name was updated from \"2019-nCoV\" to \"SARS-CoV-2\" by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, [16] yet we performed the search using the term \"nCoV\" since we presumed that no paper published between 11 February 2020 and 13 February 2020 would have used the term \"SARS-COV-2\". To achieve the highest sensitivity, we decided to use only a combination of keywords avoiding Mesh terms. Asterisks are used to truncate words, so that every ending after the asterisks was searched. We placed a language restriction for English, without other limits to the search.\\nThe papers were than classified on the basis of a standardized list of key information including: Digital Object Identifier number (DOI), title, journal name, day of first publication (online or paper form), country of the first author affiliation, article type, source of the data and topics addressed. The topics addressed were identified according to 8 categories: generic discussion, epidemiology, virology, pathology and clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapy, transmission, preparedness. Articles that addressed more than a topic in an extensive way were accounted for more than one of the 8 topic categories; the papers that could not be classified in any of the 8 chosen topic categories were classified in the \"Other\" topic category. Eight of us (FS, EA, EB, EB, FE, FM, FS, SS) independently screened all identified articles. Procedure was carried out through title and abstract scanning in order to verify the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus between the reviewers. If disagreement persisted, another reviewer (DG) was called as tie-breaker.\\nThe \"Number Needed to Read\" (NNR) is defined as the ratio of the number of retrieved abstracts to the number of the ones which are pertinent for the research purpose. [17] We calculated the NNR to identify the proportion of papers which were not editorials and commentaries, as well as the proportion of papers with directly collected data. Chi2 test was used in order to test for significant differences in the comparison of percentages, using the statistical software STATA 15 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC).\\nA total of 442 papers were retrieved; 234 articles were found to be pertinent (see Figure 1 ) and read in extenso in order to define their main characteristics. The affiliation of the first authors was distributed among 36 countries: 36.3% of the papers (85 out of 234) had a first author with a Chinese affiliation, 18.4% and 13.7% (43 out of 234 and 32 out of 234) had a first author with an affiliation from UK and USA respectively, while first authors affiliation from Canada accounted for 3.8% of the total (9 out of 234), from Italy for 3% (7 out of 234), and from Australia and Korea both accounted for 2.1% (5 out of 234 each). All the other countries accounted for less than 2% of the first author affiliations (less than 5 out of 234). 63.7% of the papers (149 out of 234) were editorials, commentaries or letters (mainly reported data). 10.7% of the papers (25 out of 234) were secondary papers, mainly narrative reviews, which collected the knowledge available up to that point on some specific topics (i.e. genomics of the virus, transmissibility, etc.). The remaining 25.6% (60 out of 234) were original primary studies: among these, case reports accounted for 43.3% of the total, while in vitro or in vivo studies or genomic studies accounted for 21.7% of the total. The remaining primary studies were cohort studies, case control studies and surveys. Chinese first authors published more original data and primary studies than authors from the UK and the USA (32.9% vs 4.7% of the UK and 6.3% of the USA; p<0.001), who published mostly editorials and commentaries. Of note, 61.5% of the analysed papers used reported/non original data and 15.8% used official data. Conversely, only 17.5% of the papers used data which were directly collected on the field. In 5.2% of the papers the source of the data was not clearly specified. The supplementary materials (Table 1) , available online, report all the findings of this review with the reference and description of the 234 papers selected for the bibliometric analysis.\\nAll rights reserved.

The second most frequent topic was \"Preparedness\" (23.1%): 83.3% of these papers consisted of commentaries, and only 1 paper was a primary study. The \"Epidemiology\" topic was addressed in 15.4% of the papers, and only 2 (5.6%) were primary studies. The lack of primary studies could be observed also for the \"Virology\" topic (14.1%) and the \"Transmission\" topic (12.8%), with only 12 (36.4%) and 6 (20%) papers reporting original data, respectively. On the other hand, the \"Pathology and clinical characteristics\" topic (12.8%) consisted mostly of primary studies (22, 73.3%). \"Therapy\" topic was addressed in 12% of the papers, with 9 papers (33.3%) being primary studies. The least addressed topic was \"Diagnosis\" (9.4%), with 12 papers (54.5%) reporting original data. Finally, 3% of the papers were classified in the \"Other\" topic category. Table 1 , ID: 218] assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection in specialised laboratories into the European Union/European Economic Area countries. This paper emphasized the need for countries to put in place strong measures in order to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early. It was also highlighted the need to perform molecular testing (RT-PCR, as also indicated by the WHO [19] ) on different specimens including: nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, (endo) tracheal aspirate and nasal wash. The communication report also underlined the need for a clinical validation of the test specificity and sensitivity. If nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended types of specimen for diagnostic testing an interesting brief report published by Chinese authors [20] [Supplementary materials 165, 167, 197, 222] were published in the second half of the time frame selected, mostly by authors with a Chinese affiliation. These papers addressed several aspects of COVID-19 treatment, such as interferon inhalation, use of and efficacy of antiviral drugs, potential repurposing treatments with angiotensin receptor blockers, use of antibiotics for bacterial co-infections, and respiratory support therapy (e.g. oxygen saturation, CPAP, invasive mechanical ventilation). Interestingly, one paper published on 4 February 2020 [21] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 91] investigated the possibility that the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect lung cells might be ACE2, a cell-surface protein on lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells; one of the known regulators of endocytosis for the AT2 cells is the AP2associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). The authors suggested the possibility to use high-affinity AAK1-binding drugs to inhibit endocytosis of AT2 cells, such as baricitinib (an oral, targeted All rights reserved.

The mean chance to read papers with directly collected data increased, with the NNR passing from 6.5 in January to 5.4 in February.\\nThe novel coronavirus infection that emerged two months ago (as already discussed, the new coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020) places emphasis on the importance of ensuring that health professionals, researchers and the public have the best possible scientific information.\\nBibliometrics is a scientific method widely used in many fields for quantifying and analysing published information. [22] This kind of literature analysis in the first month after the first publication in Pubmed shows a great number of papers published as expected, mainly by authors with a Chinese affiliation, followed by authors with an UK or USA affiliation. The reason for this distribution is ascribed to the fact that China is the country where the virus was originally isolated and the first one with a COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, we have to point out that, as shown in a commentary published in Nature, in recent years China produced more science PhD than any other country in the world and the Chinese government has been assuming a leading role in supporting its own scientific research.\\n[23] Therefore the research and publication response to the outbreak has been prompt and lively, giving to the scientific community many elements for understanding the new infection. The second country with the highest number of publications was the UK, followed by the USA, probably due to the fact they are the most prolific countries for scientific research. Authors from the UK and the USA wrote mostly editorials and commentaries.\\nThe publication policies of many of the most important scientific journals were adapted to quickly review and publish scientific papers on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. This strategy facilitated the spread of new knowledge on the new infection and on the outbreak. Hence, it is important to have scientific shared papers in order to reduce misinformation which is itself a public health threat. [24] In the early scientific literature we analysed there is a lack of primary studies with original data, as expected, given the very short period of time considered after the first pertinent publication on the new infection. Nevertheless, editorials, news and commentaries are important to share opinions and the viewpoint of an expert or a panel of experts, rather than on producing new scientific evidence.\\nthe variety and severity of the presentation of COVID-19. Further publication and reviews on this topic are needed to summarize the knowledge arising from all the case reports. Diagnostic tools, except for CT scan, were poorly represented and discussed, especially in terms of molecular diagnosis and standardization of the techniques. The \"Therapy\" topic was also poorly represented, since more time is needed for clinical intervention studies.\\nAnalyzing the selected time frame, the percentage of the editorials, news and commentaries has decreased. This was highlighted particularly by our analysis, which shows that from the second half of January to the first half of February the proportion of editorials and commentaries lowered the NNR, thus indicating an increase in the level of evidence produced as well as the increase of primary data availability.\\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, we based our research only on PubMed, that does not index all of the scientific impacted journals. It is strongly recommended to consult more than one relevant database when performing systematic reviews of the literature, [25] even though it has been reported that most of the high-quality articles, like those included in Cochrane Reviews, are indexed in PubMed. [26] In addition, we excluded all the publications not in English. We acknowledge that, given the outbreak started in China, this may have led to a partial selection bias. Nevertheless, papers excluded which were written in Chinese and had an English abstract, were for the greatest part reports of the Chinese Government (data not shown). We considered only the articles published until 13 February 2020, and taking into account that literature is now changing day-by-day for this topic, extending the bibliometric research for the next months would be of paramount importance.\\nIn conclusion, as far as we know, our very early review is the first bibliometric study analyzing the early scientific research output about COVID-19 from a quantitative and descriptive standpoint. Due to the huge amount of interest and concern related to this outbreak, our analysis shows that the scientific publication has been very reactive but still preliminar, with an expected deficit of original data and an excess of editorials and commentaries. Further research is needed to review and synthesize the growing knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, with a special aim on the most important knowledge gaps in terms of diagnosis and effective preventive and therapeutic measures.\\nAll authors declare no support from any organisation for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\"\\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\\nThe authors declare that all the data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information in Supplementary author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 25.20043315 doi: medRxiv preprint   -R  e  g  a  r  d  i  n  g  \"  J  o  u  r  n  a  l  P  u  b  l  i  c  a  t  i  o  n  D  a  t  e  \"  ,  s  o  m  e  d  a  t  e  s  m  a  y  b  e  c  o  n  s  e  c  u  t  i  v  e  t  o  1  3  F  e  b  r  u  a  r  y   2  0  2  0  ;  t  h  i  s  i  s  d  u  e  t  o  t  h  e  f  a  c  t  t  h  a  t  s  o  m  e  p  a  p  e  r  w  e  r  e  a  l  r  e  a  d  y  i  n  d  e  x  e  d  i  n  M  E  D  L  I  N  E  d  a  t  a  b  a  s  e   (  P  u  b  M  e  d  )  a  t  t  h  e  m  o  m  e  n  t  w  e  p  e  r  f  o  r  m  e  d  o  u  r  s  e  a  r  c author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 25.20043315 doi: medRxiv preprint \\n  "

       "      <td>estimation is complicated, however, by efforts to isolate infected individuals in hospitals or 45 other settings to decrease contact with the susceptible population. While the isolation of 46\\ninfected individuals is beneficial and should be encouraged, it challenges data analysts because 47\\nit is time-varying and reflects dynamic and often unpredictable human behavior. Moreover, the 48 rate at which infected individuals are removed from the population typically accelerates 49 throughout an epidemic as awareness of the infectious threat increases, 8 a process Drake et al 50 referred to as \"societal learning.\" 9 Obtaining accurate estimates of this time-varying removal of 51\\ninfected persons, while difficult, improves the quality of compartmental models for epidemics 52 of infectious disease. 9,10 To our knowledge, however, no work has directly compared the rate of 53 behavioral adaption across multiple epidemics, societies, and geographic settings. 54 55\\nMany factors can affect how quickly effective isolation practices are implemented, such as 56 access to health care, local public health funding, international aid, and the efficacy of 57 information campaigns. 11 Local health care practices and non-formal healthcare systems also 58 provide care to patients during epidemics and can play a part in quarantining infected 59\\nindividuals. 12 Previous work in Liberia has shown that a combination of these approaches 60 through simultaneous community engagement and clinical intervention is more effective than 61\\nany single intervention, with both health care access and utilization increasing hand-in-hand to 62\\ndecrease EVD transmission during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic. 13 While infection prevention 63\\noften includes vaccination, progress to develop effective vaccines for emerging infections is 64 slow and not necessarily more effective than isolation of infected individuals. 14 Ring vaccination 65\\nwith the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine 15 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is 66\\npromising, 16 but previous work has suggested that ring vaccination may only provide a marginal 67 benefit to rigorous contact tracing and patient isolation. 17 68 69\\nThe focus of this paper is the identification of key similarities and differences in the behavioral 70 response to outbreaks of three emerging zoonotic infections. We sought to determine how the 71 mean removal rate of infected individuals changed over the course of each outbreak as 72 measured by epidemic week and viral serial interval. Individuals often experience zoonotic and 73 emerging infections as innately more frightening than \"familiar\" diseases, leading to rapid 74 behavioral adaptations due to high perceived risk. 18 We compiled data for each outbreak location binned by epidemic week, to produce comparable 97 data for regression analysis. Epidemic weeks came from weekly onset dates described above. 98\\nWe also binned the same data by serial interval, using 12 days as the estimated serial interval 99\\nfor Ebola, 23 8 days for SARS, 24 and 7 days for MERS; 27 this was calculated as epidemic 100\\nweek/(serial interval/7). Each dataset included, per week, the number of new cases, the 101 cumulative number of cases, mean DSOH and associated standard deviation, and MRR and 102 associated standard deviation. We removed epidemic weeks from the beginning of each 103 outbreak so that the first three epidemic weeks had greater than 0 cases of disease each in 104 order to focus on population-level behavioral adaptation to large-scale disease outbreaks 105\\ninstead of adaptations to individual disease events early in an epidemic. We performed all 106 regression analyses using this binned data. 107 108\\nInitial regression analyses fit linear models to predict DSOH and MRR ( week) more than the 165 mean change in the 166 MRR of the Liberian 167\\nEbola epidemic (Fig.  168 2). The mean change 169 of the MRR in the 170\\nEbola epidemic in Lofa 171\\nCounty, Liberia, was 172 significantly higher than the mean change of the MRR for the overall Liberian epidemic and the 173 .

The three MERS outbreaks (Riyadh, Jeddah, and South Korea) did not differ 175 significantly from one another and had limited precision (Fig. 2) . 176 177\\nWe narrowed the 195 associated confidence intervals (Fig. 2) . We identified little difference in the mean change of 196 the MRR for the Ebola outbreak depending on predictor (Fig. 2) While our findings demonstrate large and statistically significant differences in MRR, it is 231\\nnotable that the calculated rates of change in the MRRs are within a factor of ten (when 232 calculated using epidemic week) to seven (when calculated using serial interval) of each other 233 (Fig. 2) , with the mean change being the lowest in the EVD outbreak in Liberia and the highest 234\\nin the MERS outbreak in South Korea. For modelers seeking to understand the epidemiology of 235 emerging infectious diseases with limited or no data from previous outbreaks, this study 236 provides a range of acceptable values for the MRR based on seven geographically distinct 237 outbreaks of three emerging diseases. Similarly, while large disparities in DSOH are obvious (Fig.  238 1), these data highlight that all societies quickly adapt to outbreaks of emerging infections. We have shown that public health practices for isolating infected individuals from the 249 susceptible population vary significantly by pathogen and location, but can in some cases be 250 predicted by the timing and serial interval of the epidemic. This study detected variation in 251 DSOH and MRR based on epidemic location and outbreak type, indicating that it may be 252 possible to estimate a general range of the rate of change in these variables over time. Due to 253\\nlocation-specific differences in DSOH and MRR, modelers who seek to develop forecasts early in 254 an outbreak would benefit from estimating an expected range for removal of infected 255 individuals using data from past outbreaks of the same pathogen in a similar setting. 256\\nFurthermore, the quality of these estimates will be impacted by the metric chosen, as seen by 257 the notable, but distinct, trends detected in DSOH and MRR. As seen in this study, utilizing a 258\\nwell-chosen response variable with a relatively small amount of data can provide material for 259\\nmaking effective forecasts about public health behavior. \\n</td>\n",

       "17  estimation is complicated, however, by efforts to isolate infected individuals in hospitals or 45 other settings to decrease contact with the susceptible population. While the isolation of 46\\ninfected individuals is beneficial and should be encouraged, it challenges data analysts because 47\\nit is time-varying and reflects dynamic and often unpredictable human behavior. Moreover, the 48 rate at which infected individuals are removed from the population typically accelerates 49 throughout an epidemic as awareness of the infectious threat increases, 8 a process Drake et al 50 referred to as \"societal learning.\" 9 Obtaining accurate estimates of this time-varying removal of 51\\ninfected persons, while difficult, improves the quality of compartmental models for epidemics 52 of infectious disease. 9,10 To our knowledge, however, no work has directly compared the rate of 53 behavioral adaption across multiple epidemics, societies, and geographic settings. 54 55\\nMany factors can affect how quickly effective isolation practices are implemented, such as 56 access to health care, local public health funding, international aid, and the efficacy of 57 information campaigns. 11 Local health care practices and non-formal healthcare systems also 58 provide care to patients during epidemics and can play a part in quarantining infected 59\\nindividuals. 12 Previous work in Liberia has shown that a combination of these approaches 60 through simultaneous community engagement and clinical intervention is more effective than 61\\nany single intervention, with both health care access and utilization increasing hand-in-hand to 62\\ndecrease EVD transmission during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic. 13 While infection prevention 63\\noften includes vaccination, progress to develop effective vaccines for emerging infections is 64 slow and not necessarily more effective than isolation of infected individuals. 14 Ring vaccination 65\\nwith the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine 15 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is 66\\npromising, 16 but previous work has suggested that ring vaccination may only provide a marginal 67 benefit to rigorous contact tracing and patient isolation. 17 68 69\\nThe focus of this paper is the identification of key similarities and differences in the behavioral 70 response to outbreaks of three emerging zoonotic infections. We sought to determine how the 71 mean removal rate of infected individuals changed over the course of each outbreak as 72 measured by epidemic week and viral serial interval. Individuals often experience zoonotic and 73 emerging infections as innately more frightening than \"familiar\" diseases, leading to rapid 74 behavioral adaptations due to high perceived risk. 18 We compiled data for each outbreak location binned by epidemic week, to produce comparable 97 data for regression analysis. Epidemic weeks came from weekly onset dates described above. 98\\nWe also binned the same data by serial interval, using 12 days as the estimated serial interval 99\\nfor Ebola, 23 8 days for SARS, 24 and 7 days for MERS; 27 this was calculated as epidemic 100\\nweek/(serial interval/7). Each dataset included, per week, the number of new cases, the 101 cumulative number of cases, mean DSOH and associated standard deviation, and MRR and 102 associated standard deviation. We removed epidemic weeks from the beginning of each 103 outbreak so that the first three epidemic weeks had greater than 0 cases of disease each in 104 order to focus on population-level behavioral adaptation to large-scale disease outbreaks 105\\ninstead of adaptations to individual disease events early in an epidemic. We performed all 106 regression analyses using this binned data. 107 108\\nInitial regression analyses fit linear models to predict DSOH and MRR ( week) more than the 165 mean change in the 166 MRR of the Liberian 167\\nEbola epidemic (Fig.  168 2). The mean change 169 of the MRR in the 170\\nEbola epidemic in Lofa 171\\nCounty, Liberia, was 172 significantly higher than the mean change of the MRR for the overall Liberian epidemic and the 173 .

The three MERS outbreaks (Riyadh, Jeddah, and South Korea) did not differ 175 significantly from one another and had limited precision (Fig. 2) . 176 177\\nWe narrowed the 195 associated confidence intervals (Fig. 2) . We identified little difference in the mean change of 196 the MRR for the Ebola outbreak depending on predictor (Fig. 2) While our findings demonstrate large and statistically significant differences in MRR, it is 231\\nnotable that the calculated rates of change in the MRRs are within a factor of ten (when 232 calculated using epidemic week) to seven (when calculated using serial interval) of each other 233 (Fig. 2) , with the mean change being the lowest in the EVD outbreak in Liberia and the highest 234\\nin the MERS outbreak in South Korea. For modelers seeking to understand the epidemiology of 235 emerging infectious diseases with limited or no data from previous outbreaks, this study 236 provides a range of acceptable values for the MRR based on seven geographically distinct 237 outbreaks of three emerging diseases. Similarly, while large disparities in DSOH are obvious (Fig.  238 1), these data highlight that all societies quickly adapt to outbreaks of emerging infections. We have shown that public health practices for isolating infected individuals from the 249 susceptible population vary significantly by pathogen and location, but can in some cases be 250 predicted by the timing and serial interval of the epidemic. This study detected variation in 251 DSOH and MRR based on epidemic location and outbreak type, indicating that it may be 252 possible to estimate a general range of the rate of change in these variables over time. Due to 253\\nlocation-specific differences in DSOH and MRR, modelers who seek to develop forecasts early in 254 an outbreak would benefit from estimating an expected range for removal of infected 255 individuals using data from past outbreaks of the same pathogen in a similar setting. 256\\nFurthermore, the quality of these estimates will be impacted by the metric chosen, as seen by 257 the notable, but distinct, trends detected in DSOH and MRR. As seen in this study, utilizing a 258\\nwell-chosen response variable with a relatively small amount of data can provide material for 259\\nmaking effective forecasts about public health behavior. \\n  "

       "      <td>have issues in the lack of inducing complete protection and possible safety concerns 7,8 . All 77 existing SARS/MERS vaccines were reported to induce neutralizing antibodies and partial 78 protection against the viral challenges in animal models (Table 2) , but it is desired to induce 79 complete protection or sterile immunity. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that multiple 80 immune responses, including those induced by humoral or cell-mediated immunity, are 81 responsible for correlates of protection than antibody titers alone 9 . Both killed SARS-CoV whole 82 virus vaccine and adenovirus-based recombinant vector vaccines expressing S or N proteins 83 induced neutralizing antibody responses but did not provide complete protection in animal 84 model 10 . A study has shown increased liver pathology in the vaccinated ferrets immunized with 85 modified vaccinia Ankara-S recombinant vaccine 11 . The safety and efficacy of these vaccination 86\\nstrategies have not been fully tested in human clinical trials, but the safety can be a major 87 concern. Therefore, novel strategies are needed to enhance the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 88 vaccine development. 89\\nIn recent years, the development of vaccine design has been revolutionized by the reverse 90 vaccinology (RV), which aims to first identify promising vaccine candidate through 91 bioinformatics analysis of the pathogen genome. RV has been successfully applied to vaccine 92 discovery for pathogens such as Group B meningococcus and led to the license Bexsero 93 vaccine 12 . Among current RV prediction tools 13,14 , Vaxign is the first web-based RV program 15 94 and has been used to successfully predict vaccine candidates against different bacterial and viral 95 pathogens [16] [17] [18] . Recently we have also developed a machine learning approach called Vaxign-ML 96 to enhance prediction accuracy 19 . 97\\nIn this study, we first surveyed the existing coronavirus vaccine development status, and 98 then applied the Vaxign RV and Vaxign-ML approaches to predict COVID-19 protein 99 candidates for vaccine development. We identified six possible adhesins, including the structural 100 protein and non-structural proteins (including nsp3) using reverse vaccinology and machine 107 learning, we proposed and discussed a cocktail vaccine strategy, for rational COVID (Table 2) . 128 more typically mild HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. The sequence 138 conservation suggested the potential of N protein as a candidate for the cross-protective vaccine 139 against SARS and MERS. The N protein was also evaluated and used for vaccine development 140 (Table 2 ). The N protein packs the coronavirus RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid in virion 141 assembly. This protein is more conserved than the S protein and was reported to induce an 142 immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections 23 . However, a study also showed the 143 linkage between N protein and severe pneumonia or other serious liver failures related to the 144 pathogenesis of SARS 24 . 145 146 Six adhesive proteins in SARS-CoV-2 identified as potential vaccine targets 147\\nThe Vaxign RV analysis predicted six SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S protein, nsp3, 3CL-PRO, 148 and nsp8-10) as adhesive proteins (Table 3) . Adhesin plays a critical role in the virus adhering to 149 the host cell and facilitating the virus entry to the host cell 25 , which has a significant association 150 with the vaccine-induced protection 26 . In SARS-CoV-2, S protein was predicted to be adhesin, 151 matching its primary role in virus entry. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined 27 152 and reported to contribute to the host cell entry by interacting with the angiotensin-converting 153 enzyme 2 (ACE2) 28 . Besides S protein, the other five predicted adhesive proteins were all non-154 structural proteins. In particular, nsp3 is the largest non-structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 155 comprises various functional domains 29 . 156 157 Three adhesin proteins were predicted to induce strong protective immunity 158\\nThe Vaxign-ML pipeline computed the protegenicity (protective antigenicity) score and 159 predicted the induction of protective immunity by a vaccine candidate 19 . The training data 160 consisted of viral protective antigens, which were tested to be protective in at least one animal 161 challenge model 30 . The performance of the Vaxign-ML models was evaluated (Table S1 and 162 Figure S1 ), and the best performing model had a weighted F1-score of 0.94. Using the optimized 163 Vaxign-ML model, we predicted three proteins (S protein, nsp3, and nsp8) as vaccine candidates 164 with significant protegenicity scores ( Table 3 ). The S protein was predicted to have the highest 165 protegenicity score, which is consistent with the experimental observations reported in the 166 literature. The nsp3 protein is the second most promising vaccine candidate besides S protein. 167\\nThere was currently no study of nsp3 as a vaccine target. The structure and functions of this protein 168 .

Therefore, we selected nsp3 for further investigation, as described 170 below. 171\\nThe multiple sequence alignment and the resulting phylogeny of nsp3 protein showed that 174 this protein in SARS-CoV-2 was more closely related to the human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and 175 MERS-CoV, and bat coronaviruses BtCoV/HKU3, BtCoV/HKU4, and BtCoV/HKU9. We studied 176 the genetic conservation of nsp3 protein ( Figure 1A (Table S4 -5). In terms of linear B cell epitopes, there were 14 epitopes with BepiPred 195 scores over 0.55 and had at least ten amino acids in length (Table S6) (Table 2 ). But the inactivated or attenuated whole virus vaccine might induce strong 218 adverse events. On the other hand, vaccines targeting the structural proteins induce a strong 219 immune response 23,32,33 . In some studies, these structural proteins, including the S and N proteins, 220 were reported to associate with the pathogenesis of coronavirus 24,34 and might raise safety 221 concern 11 . Our study applied state-of-the-art Vaxign reserve vaccinology (RV) and Vaxign-ML 222 only the S protein may induce high serum-neutralizing antibody titers but cannot induce complete 231 protection 10 . In addition, HCoV-NL63 also uses S protein and employs the angiotensin-converting 232 enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cellular entry, despite markedly weak pathogenicity 35 . This suggests that the 233 S protein is not the only factor determining the infection level of a human coronavirus. Thus, 234 alternative vaccine antigens may be considered as potential targets for COVID-19 vaccines. 235\\nAmong the five non-structural proteins being predicted as potential vaccine candidates, the 236 nsp3 protein was predicted to have second-highest protective antigenicity score, adhesin property, 237 promiscuous MHC-I &amp; MHC-II T cell epitopes, and B cell epitopes. The nsp3 is the largest non-238 structural protein that includes multiple functional domains related to viral pathogenesis 29 . The 239 multiple sequence alignment of nsp3 also showed higher sequence conservation in most of the 240 functional domains in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, than in all 15 coronavirus 241 strains (Fig. 1B) . Besides the nsp3 protein, our study also predicted four additional non-structural 242 proteins (3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10) as possible vaccine candidates based on their adhesin 243 probabilities, and the nsp8 protein was also predicted to have a significant protective antigenicity 244 score. 245\\nHowever, these predicted non-structural proteins (nasp3, 3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10) 246 are not part of the viral structural particle, and all the current SARS/MERS/COVID-19 vaccine 247 studies target the structural (S/M/N) proteins. Although structural proteins are commonly used as 248 viral vaccine candidates, non-structural proteins correlates to vaccine protection. The non-249 structural protein NS1 was found to induce protective immunity against the infections by 250 flaviviruses 36 . Since NS1 is not part of the virion, antibodies against NS1 have no neutralizing 251 activity but some exhibit complement-fixing activity 37 . However, passive transfer of anti-NS1 252 antibody or immunization with NS1 conferred protection 38 . Anti-NS1 antibody could also reduce 253 might induce cell-mediated or humoral immunity necessary to prevent viral invasion and/or 262 replication. None of the non-structural proteins have been evaluated as vaccine candidates, and the 263 feasibilit of these proteins as vaccine targets are subject to further experimental verification. 264\\nIn addition to vaccines expressing a single or a combination of structural proteins, here we 265\\npropose an \"Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine\" as an effective strategy for COVID-19 vaccine development. including logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, random forest 60 , and 315 of 14 coronaviruses besides SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the Uniprot (Table S2) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint\\n</td>\n",

       "39  have issues in the lack of inducing complete protection and possible safety concerns 7,8 . All 77 existing SARS/MERS vaccines were reported to induce neutralizing antibodies and partial 78 protection against the viral challenges in animal models (Table 2) , but it is desired to induce 79 complete protection or sterile immunity. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that multiple 80 immune responses, including those induced by humoral or cell-mediated immunity, are 81 responsible for correlates of protection than antibody titers alone 9 . Both killed SARS-CoV whole 82 virus vaccine and adenovirus-based recombinant vector vaccines expressing S or N proteins 83 induced neutralizing antibody responses but did not provide complete protection in animal 84 model 10 . A study has shown increased liver pathology in the vaccinated ferrets immunized with 85 modified vaccinia Ankara-S recombinant vaccine 11 . The safety and efficacy of these vaccination 86\\nstrategies have not been fully tested in human clinical trials, but the safety can be a major 87 concern. Therefore, novel strategies are needed to enhance the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 88 vaccine development. 89\\nIn recent years, the development of vaccine design has been revolutionized by the reverse 90 vaccinology (RV), which aims to first identify promising vaccine candidate through 91 bioinformatics analysis of the pathogen genome. RV has been successfully applied to vaccine 92 discovery for pathogens such as Group B meningococcus and led to the license Bexsero 93 vaccine 12 . Among current RV prediction tools 13,14 , Vaxign is the first web-based RV program 15 94 and has been used to successfully predict vaccine candidates against different bacterial and viral 95 pathogens [16] [17] [18] . Recently we have also developed a machine learning approach called Vaxign-ML 96 to enhance prediction accuracy 19 . 97\\nIn this study, we first surveyed the existing coronavirus vaccine development status, and 98 then applied the Vaxign RV and Vaxign-ML approaches to predict COVID-19 protein 99 candidates for vaccine development. We identified six possible adhesins, including the structural 100 protein and non-structural proteins (including nsp3) using reverse vaccinology and machine 107 learning, we proposed and discussed a cocktail vaccine strategy, for rational COVID (Table 2) . 128 more typically mild HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. The sequence 138 conservation suggested the potential of N protein as a candidate for the cross-protective vaccine 139 against SARS and MERS. The N protein was also evaluated and used for vaccine development 140 (Table 2 ). The N protein packs the coronavirus RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid in virion 141 assembly. This protein is more conserved than the S protein and was reported to induce an 142 immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections 23 . However, a study also showed the 143 linkage between N protein and severe pneumonia or other serious liver failures related to the 144 pathogenesis of SARS 24 . 145 146 Six adhesive proteins in SARS-CoV-2 identified as potential vaccine targets 147\\nThe Vaxign RV analysis predicted six SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S protein, nsp3, 3CL-PRO, 148 and nsp8-10) as adhesive proteins (Table 3) . Adhesin plays a critical role in the virus adhering to 149 the host cell and facilitating the virus entry to the host cell 25 , which has a significant association 150 with the vaccine-induced protection 26 . In SARS-CoV-2, S protein was predicted to be adhesin, 151 matching its primary role in virus entry. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined 27 152 and reported to contribute to the host cell entry by interacting with the angiotensin-converting 153 enzyme 2 (ACE2) 28 . Besides S protein, the other five predicted adhesive proteins were all non-154 structural proteins. In particular, nsp3 is the largest non-structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 155 comprises various functional domains 29 . 156 157 Three adhesin proteins were predicted to induce strong protective immunity 158\\nThe Vaxign-ML pipeline computed the protegenicity (protective antigenicity) score and 159 predicted the induction of protective immunity by a vaccine candidate 19 . The training data 160 consisted of viral protective antigens, which were tested to be protective in at least one animal 161 challenge model 30 . The performance of the Vaxign-ML models was evaluated (Table S1 and 162 Figure S1 ), and the best performing model had a weighted F1-score of 0.94. Using the optimized 163 Vaxign-ML model, we predicted three proteins (S protein, nsp3, and nsp8) as vaccine candidates 164 with significant protegenicity scores ( Table 3 ). The S protein was predicted to have the highest 165 protegenicity score, which is consistent with the experimental observations reported in the 166 literature. The nsp3 protein is the second most promising vaccine candidate besides S protein. 167\\nThere was currently no study of nsp3 as a vaccine target. The structure and functions of this protein 168 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint evasion and virus survival) 29 . Therefore, we selected nsp3 for further investigation, as described 170 below. 171\\nThe multiple sequence alignment and the resulting phylogeny of nsp3 protein showed that 174 this protein in SARS-CoV-2 was more closely related to the human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and 175 MERS-CoV, and bat coronaviruses BtCoV/HKU3, BtCoV/HKU4, and BtCoV/HKU9. We studied 176 the genetic conservation of nsp3 protein ( Figure 1A (Table S4 -5). In terms of linear B cell epitopes, there were 14 epitopes with BepiPred 195 scores over 0.55 and had at least ten amino acids in length (Table S6) (Table 2 ). But the inactivated or attenuated whole virus vaccine might induce strong 218 adverse events. On the other hand, vaccines targeting the structural proteins induce a strong 219 immune response 23,32,33 . In some studies, these structural proteins, including the S and N proteins, 220 were reported to associate with the pathogenesis of coronavirus 24,34 and might raise safety 221 concern 11 . Our study applied state-of-the-art Vaxign reserve vaccinology (RV) and Vaxign-ML 222 only the S protein may induce high serum-neutralizing antibody titers but cannot induce complete 231 protection 10 . In addition, HCoV-NL63 also uses S protein and employs the angiotensin-converting 232 enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cellular entry, despite markedly weak pathogenicity 35 . This suggests that the 233 S protein is not the only factor determining the infection level of a human coronavirus. Thus, 234 alternative vaccine antigens may be considered as potential targets for COVID-19 vaccines. 235\\nAmong the five non-structural proteins being predicted as potential vaccine candidates, the 236 nsp3 protein was predicted to have second-highest protective antigenicity score, adhesin property, 237 promiscuous MHC-I & MHC-II T cell epitopes, and B cell epitopes. The nsp3 is the largest non-238 structural protein that includes multiple functional domains related to viral pathogenesis 29 . The 239 multiple sequence alignment of nsp3 also showed higher sequence conservation in most of the 240 functional domains in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, than in all 15 coronavirus 241 strains (Fig. 1B) . Besides the nsp3 protein, our study also predicted four additional non-structural 242 proteins (3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10) as possible vaccine candidates based on their adhesin 243 probabilities, and the nsp8 protein was also predicted to have a significant protective antigenicity 244 score. 245\\nHowever, these predicted non-structural proteins (nasp3, 3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10) 246 are not part of the viral structural particle, and all the current SARS/MERS/COVID-19 vaccine 247 studies target the structural (S/M/N) proteins. Although structural proteins are commonly used as 248 viral vaccine candidates, non-structural proteins correlates to vaccine protection. The non-249 structural protein NS1 was found to induce protective immunity against the infections by 250 flaviviruses 36 . Since NS1 is not part of the virion, antibodies against NS1 have no neutralizing 251 activity but some exhibit complement-fixing activity 37 . However, passive transfer of anti-NS1 252 antibody or immunization with NS1 conferred protection 38 . Anti-NS1 antibody could also reduce 253 might induce cell-mediated or humoral immunity necessary to prevent viral invasion and/or 262 replication. None of the non-structural proteins have been evaluated as vaccine candidates, and the 263 feasibilit of these proteins as vaccine targets are subject to further experimental verification. 264\\nIn addition to vaccines expressing a single or a combination of structural proteins, here we 265\\npropose an \"Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine\" as an effective strategy for COVID-19 vaccine development. including logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, random forest 60 , and 315 of 14 coronaviruses besides SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the Uniprot (Table S2) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint\\n  "

       "      <td>An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently renamed CoVID-19, was first reported from Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. During January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, and the first cases started appearing outside China. By the end of January 2020, 9,720 cases had been confirmed in China, with 106 confirmed cases outside China across 19 different countries (1) .\\nEpidemiological analysis of the outbreak was quickly used to start estimating epidemiologicallyrelevant parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the serial interval, the incubation period and the case fatality rate (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Initial estimates suggested that the reproduction number was between 2 and 3 and the case fatality rate was less than 4% (8) . Control of spread by contact tracing and isolation appears to be challenging, given what is currently known about the virus (9) .\\nMathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the possible course of an outbreak, given a set of underlying assumptions. Here, we adapt a metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales to capture the spread of CoVID-19 (10) . The aim is to provide predictions about the likely timing of the peak of the epidemic in England and Wales and spatial features of spread.\\nWe use an existing national-scale stochastic metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales. The model structure is based on the metapopulation model described in detail in Danon et al (2009) (10) . In this model, the population is divided into electoral wards. Because of the changes in data availability, we restricted the model to England and Wales, whereas the original model covered Great Britain.\\nTransmission between wards occurs via the daily movement of individuals. For each ward, we assume that individuals contribute to the force of infection in their \"home\" ward during the night and their \"work\" ward during the day. See Danon et al 2009 for further details (10) .\\nData for population and movement of individuals come from the 2011 census of the United Kingdom. The population size of each of the 8,570 electoral wards is available directly from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) website. The number of individuals moving between locations is also available from the ONS website, but at the level of census output areas (OAs). We aggregated the data from OA level to electoral wards level. Spatial location of electoral ward centres are extracted from maps available from the ONS websites.\\nWe use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Infectious-Recovered (SEIIR) model within each ward to capture the progression of disease within an individual (figure 1). Initial analyses used SARS-like parameters for the incubation period and infectious period, which now appear to differ from CoVID-19(4). Li et al (2020) analysed data on 425 cases reported in Wuhan in China and fitted a log-normal distribution to the incubation period, and a gamma distribution for the serial interval (2) . The infectious period for SARS was estimated as the serial interval minus the .

We used two infectious states to represent a mildly symptomatic or prodromal period and a period with more pronounced symptoms. In the absence of data on the relative magnitude of these two infections states, we assumed the same length of time in each infectious state and assumed that each state was equally infectious. We sampled from each of the distributions 100 times independently (Table 1 ). \\nThe census data are used to initialise the population sizes within each of the 8,570 wards. At the start of the model, all individuals are assumed to be susceptible to infection with no 3 e .

We investigated a range of starting scenarios by seeding the infection in example wards London, Birmingham, Brighton, Sheffield and Cardiff. To seed infection in a ward, we move five individuals (non-commuters) from the susceptible compartment to the first infectious state.\\nWe investigated the impact of a seasonally affected transmission rate, to capture potential decreased transmission during the summer months. We captured seasonal transmission by replacing the constant transmission rate with a time-varying transmission rate given by:\\nis the magnitude of the seasonal difference in transmission, ranging from\\n(maximum seasonality with no transmission at the peak of the summer).\\nFrom the model, we extracted the total number of infections per day, as the number of individuals in both of the Infectious states, and the number of infected wards per day as the total number of wards with at least one individual in one of the two Infectious states. The spatial growth of the epidemic in England and Wales was visualised using interactive maps. We estimated the timing of the epidemic peak from the aggregated epidemic curve and calculated 95% prediction intervals from the model simulations.\\nThe model is coded in C and is available on github (http://github.com/ldanon/MetaWards). The data are freely available from the Office for National Statistics website, or can be downloaded with the code at the github repository.\\nWe predict that, in the absence of any interventions, a disease with \"best-guess\" CoVID-19-like parameters will peak a median of 133 days (range 126 -147 days) following the start of personto-person transmission in England and Wales. Intrinsic model stochasticity is responsible for variation between model runs. Using exactly the same parameters and seeding the infection in the same initial wards resulted in a difference in peak timing of +/-10 days (figure 2). The attack rate for best-guess parameters had a median of 45799874 (81.67% range 81.64-81.69), with a peak incidence median 1,116,692.\\n.

Epidemics seeded in Brighton, London, Birmingham and Sheffield resulted in synchronised epidemics in England, reaching urban areas first followed by rural areas. Epidemics started in Cardiff had a slower time to peak but still resulted in a generalised outbreak.\\nSpatially, some disaggregation between England and Wales regions is observed. An outbreak starting in Brighton, (South East England) peaks in London and the South East first, and North East England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales last, with a ten-day lag between regions ( Figure 3 ).\\nModel predictions are highly sensitive to parameter values and incorporating parameter uncertainty increases the variability of model predictions. In the absence of any control measures, all predictions resulted in epidemics that peaked within a year from the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales. Estimates of peak time ranged from 78 days to 241 days (Figure 4 ).\\n.

Assuming no difference in transmission rate during the year leads to a single large epidemic after approximately 4 months (June time if transmission starts in February), as above. With a 25% reduction in transmission the epidemic is smaller and peaks later, reducing the overall attack rate by 20%. A 50% reduction in transmission results in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. The attack rate is 10% less than a non-seasonal epidemic. A 75% reduction in transmission over the summer resulted in a delayed large outbreak, but with a similar attack rate. If transmission decreases to zero over the summer then the resulting outbreak is much reduced, with an attack rate of less than 1% ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ). .

Our findings suggest that the height of the epidemic and the attack rate is highly dependent on seasonality of transmission and that even small changes in transmission risk can lead to large changes in attack rate due to the spatial disaggregation of the population at risk.\\nA combination of control measures and seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the peak of the outbreak to the winter of 2020/21, with little effect on the final attack rate. If contact tracing and isolation efforts succeed in reducing transmission, but are unable to control the epidemic (9), an additional influx of severe CoVID-19 cases may exacerbate existing challenges with winter healthcare demand. A careful analysis of the impact of control measures on the timing of incidence of severe cases is warranted.\\nThe strength of this model lies in the spatial heterogeneity which tempers transmission. As a comparison, an equivalent non-spatial model results in the epidemic peaking after 34 days, nearly four times faster than this spatial model, and would be unable to capture the interaction between spatial transmission and seasonality. The estimated total number of people infected in the spatial model is marginally smaller than for a non-spatial model, as the infection has the opportunity to die-out in local parts of the country. As the model framework was developed and published in 2009, it was possible to re-deploy the model for these new circumstances; developing such a model from scratch during an outbreak would be a significant challenge.\\nA key element missing from our model is morbidity, mortality and the treatment of cases. The model in its current form predicts the total number of infections in the community rather than diagnosed cases. Observations from China suggest that many cases have mild symptoms and that only around 5% of cases have been reported and diagnosed (3) . The parameter estimates we used from China appear to be substantially different to previous coronaviruses (6) . Should CoVID-19 continue spreading the UK it will become possible to get UK-specific parameter estimates and improve prediction accuracy.\\nAs with all modelling, it is impossible to capture the full complexity of an epidemic. In this model, the major assumptions are that we have assumed that there is no change in behaviour during the course of the epidemic. In practice, as the epidemic starts spreading in England and Wales there may well be a systematic change in behaviour as was seen during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. We have not included any age-effects, such as differential mixing, susceptibility or infectiousness. That means that we are not able to investigate the impact of school closures or the impact of the summer holidays, which had a large impact on the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009.\\n</td>\n",

       "31  An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently renamed CoVID-19, was first reported from Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. During January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, and the first cases started appearing outside China. By the end of January 2020, 9,720 cases had been confirmed in China, with 106 confirmed cases outside China across 19 different countries (1) .\\nEpidemiological analysis of the outbreak was quickly used to start estimating epidemiologicallyrelevant parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the serial interval, the incubation period and the case fatality rate (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Initial estimates suggested that the reproduction number was between 2 and 3 and the case fatality rate was less than 4% (8) . Control of spread by contact tracing and isolation appears to be challenging, given what is currently known about the virus (9) .\\nMathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the possible course of an outbreak, given a set of underlying assumptions. Here, we adapt a metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales to capture the spread of CoVID-19 (10) . The aim is to provide predictions about the likely timing of the peak of the epidemic in England and Wales and spatial features of spread.\\nWe use an existing national-scale stochastic metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales. The model structure is based on the metapopulation model described in detail in Danon et al (2009) (10) . In this model, the population is divided into electoral wards. Because of the changes in data availability, we restricted the model to England and Wales, whereas the original model covered Great Britain.\\nTransmission between wards occurs via the daily movement of individuals. For each ward, we assume that individuals contribute to the force of infection in their \"home\" ward during the night and their \"work\" ward during the day. See Danon et al 2009 for further details (10) .\\nData for population and movement of individuals come from the 2011 census of the United Kingdom. The population size of each of the 8,570 electoral wards is available directly from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) website. The number of individuals moving between locations is also available from the ONS website, but at the level of census output areas (OAs). We aggregated the data from OA level to electoral wards level. Spatial location of electoral ward centres are extracted from maps available from the ONS websites.\\nWe use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Infectious-Recovered (SEIIR) model within each ward to capture the progression of disease within an individual (figure 1). Initial analyses used SARS-like parameters for the incubation period and infectious period, which now appear to differ from CoVID-19(4). Li et al (2020) analysed data on 425 cases reported in Wuhan in China and fitted a log-normal distribution to the incubation period, and a gamma distribution for the serial interval (2) . The infectious period for SARS was estimated as the serial interval minus the .

We used two infectious states to represent a mildly symptomatic or prodromal period and a period with more pronounced symptoms. In the absence of data on the relative magnitude of these two infections states, we assumed the same length of time in each infectious state and assumed that each state was equally infectious. We sampled from each of the distributions 100 times independently (Table 1 ). \\nThe census data are used to initialise the population sizes within each of the 8,570 wards. At the start of the model, all individuals are assumed to be susceptible to infection with no 3 e .

We investigated a range of starting scenarios by seeding the infection in example wards London, Birmingham, Brighton, Sheffield and Cardiff. To seed infection in a ward, we move five individuals (non-commuters) from the susceptible compartment to the first infectious state.\\nWe investigated the impact of a seasonally affected transmission rate, to capture potential decreased transmission during the summer months. We captured seasonal transmission by replacing the constant transmission rate with a time-varying transmission rate given by:\\nis the magnitude of the seasonal difference in transmission, ranging from\\n(maximum seasonality with no transmission at the peak of the summer).\\nFrom the model, we extracted the total number of infections per day, as the number of individuals in both of the Infectious states, and the number of infected wards per day as the total number of wards with at least one individual in one of the two Infectious states. The spatial growth of the epidemic in England and Wales was visualised using interactive maps. We estimated the timing of the epidemic peak from the aggregated epidemic curve and calculated 95% prediction intervals from the model simulations.\\nThe model is coded in C and is available on github (http://github.com/ldanon/MetaWards). The data are freely available from the Office for National Statistics website, or can be downloaded with the code at the github repository.\\nWe predict that, in the absence of any interventions, a disease with \"best-guess\" CoVID-19-like parameters will peak a median of 133 days (range 126 -147 days) following the start of personto-person transmission in England and Wales. Intrinsic model stochasticity is responsible for variation between model runs. Using exactly the same parameters and seeding the infection in the same initial wards resulted in a difference in peak timing of +/-10 days (figure 2). The attack rate for best-guess parameters had a median of 45799874 (81.67% range 81.64-81.69), with a peak incidence median 1,116,692.\\n.

Epidemics seeded in Brighton, London, Birmingham and Sheffield resulted in synchronised epidemics in England, reaching urban areas first followed by rural areas. Epidemics started in Cardiff had a slower time to peak but still resulted in a generalised outbreak.\\nSpatially, some disaggregation between England and Wales regions is observed. An outbreak starting in Brighton, (South East England) peaks in London and the South East first, and North East England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales last, with a ten-day lag between regions ( Figure 3 ).\\nModel predictions are highly sensitive to parameter values and incorporating parameter uncertainty increases the variability of model predictions. In the absence of any control measures, all predictions resulted in epidemics that peaked within a year from the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales. Estimates of peak time ranged from 78 days to 241 days (Figure 4 ).\\n.

Assuming no difference in transmission rate during the year leads to a single large epidemic after approximately 4 months (June time if transmission starts in February), as above. With a 25% reduction in transmission the epidemic is smaller and peaks later, reducing the overall attack rate by 20%. A 50% reduction in transmission results in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. The attack rate is 10% less than a non-seasonal epidemic. A 75% reduction in transmission over the summer resulted in a delayed large outbreak, but with a similar attack rate. If transmission decreases to zero over the summer then the resulting outbreak is much reduced, with an attack rate of less than 1% ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ). .

Our findings suggest that the height of the epidemic and the attack rate is highly dependent on seasonality of transmission and that even small changes in transmission risk can lead to large changes in attack rate due to the spatial disaggregation of the population at risk.\\nA combination of control measures and seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the peak of the outbreak to the winter of 2020/21, with little effect on the final attack rate. If contact tracing and isolation efforts succeed in reducing transmission, but are unable to control the epidemic (9), an additional influx of severe CoVID-19 cases may exacerbate existing challenges with winter healthcare demand. A careful analysis of the impact of control measures on the timing of incidence of severe cases is warranted.\\nThe strength of this model lies in the spatial heterogeneity which tempers transmission. As a comparison, an equivalent non-spatial model results in the epidemic peaking after 34 days, nearly four times faster than this spatial model, and would be unable to capture the interaction between spatial transmission and seasonality. The estimated total number of people infected in the spatial model is marginally smaller than for a non-spatial model, as the infection has the opportunity to die-out in local parts of the country. As the model framework was developed and published in 2009, it was possible to re-deploy the model for these new circumstances; developing such a model from scratch during an outbreak would be a significant challenge.\\nA key element missing from our model is morbidity, mortality and the treatment of cases. The model in its current form predicts the total number of infections in the community rather than diagnosed cases. Observations from China suggest that many cases have mild symptoms and that only around 5% of cases have been reported and diagnosed (3) . The parameter estimates we used from China appear to be substantially different to previous coronaviruses (6) . Should CoVID-19 continue spreading the UK it will become possible to get UK-specific parameter estimates and improve prediction accuracy.\\nAs with all modelling, it is impossible to capture the full complexity of an epidemic. In this model, the major assumptions are that we have assumed that there is no change in behaviour during the course of the epidemic. In practice, as the epidemic starts spreading in England and Wales there may well be a systematic change in behaviour as was seen during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. We have not included any age-effects, such as differential mixing, susceptibility or infectiousness. That means that we are not able to investigate the impact of school closures or the impact of the summer holidays, which had a large impact on the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009.\\n  "

       "      <td>[{'text': 'Since the introduction of the novel Corona Virus to the Chinese city Wuhan in the Hubei province during the late December 2019, the effectiveness of the deadly disease, its human infection, spreading severity and the mortality rate of the infection has been an issue of debate. The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID-19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': 'By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility-Exposure-Infection-Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India.

       "      <td>Since the Novel Corona Virus 19 was first detected in Hubei province of Chinese country in Wuhan City in late December 2019, it has been spreading rapidly across the globe (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020; Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020) . Furthermore, by the end of March 2020, COVID-19 had been detected in most of the countries globally leading a pandemic situation (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020) . Nevertheless, the COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic by The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11\\nMarch 2020.\\nSubsequently, as of 15 March 2020, 1 69 517 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide by more than 150 countries. Since late February, the majority of cases reported are from outside China, with an increasing number of these reported mainly from the USA, Italy. Spain and from most part of EU/EEA countries and the UK (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020; WHO, 2020) . As the number of infections among the globe increases, several thousands of cases are reported by EU/EEA countries to be dead due to the severe illness caused by the COVID-19 infections. Further, on March 25 th , the world report (WHO, 2020) on corona virus infections reported that, Italy represents 15 % of the infected cases (74, 386) and 35 % of the fatalities (7,503) of the total infected and dead cases reported around the globe.\\nThe current hop of the increase in cases around the EU/EEA and the UK reflects the trends which had been realised in China during the January and early February 2020. In the present situation where COVID-19 infections are hastily spreading worldwide and as initially the number of cases in Europe were rising with an increasing pace in several affected areas, but now a days due to the infected travellers moving around the globe for various activities are spreading the infections to the persons who come in near contact with the infected individuals. Due to such mass transmission of the infections, there is a need for instantaneous targeted action towards the spread of COVID-19. The speed with which COVID-19 can cause nationally devastating epidemics once transmission within the community is established (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020) which specifies that may be in a few weeks or even days, it is most likely that situations to those seen in China, USA and Italy may be seen in other states of India.\\nSignificantly, at this current situation there are no proven medicines for curing the COVID-19 or vaccines to prevent the transmission of the infections but instead there are only very few evidences on the effectiveness of potential therapeutic treatments to improve the immune system of an individual as a precaution. The clinical demonstrations of COVID-19 range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to respiratory problems and lastly to severe pneumonia; severe infections can induce multi-organ failure and lead to death (WHO, 2020) . The majority of reported cases (80%) are with milder respiratory infections and pneumonias. It is noticed that severe illness and deaths are more common among the ageing population with other chronic pre-existing conditions. These are the risk groups which are accounting for the majority of severe disease and fatalities to date (Rhonda, Sue., Roberts., Ivo, M Foppa., 2006) .\\nPreviously, several pandemics such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), Ebola, HIV/AIDS, pandemic influenza has been reported to be originated in animals which are caused by viruses, and are determined to develop by behavioural, environmental conditions, or socioeconomic fluctuations (Stephen, S Morse., Jonna, A. K. Mazet., Mark, Woolhouse., Colin, R. Parrish., Dennis, Carroll., William, B. Karesh., Carlos, Zambrana-Torrelio., 2012) . The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic was one of the most closely tracked and studied epidemics in history (Manoj, G., Catherine, B., Justin, J., Amra, U., Lucinda, E. J., Matthew, B., 2015) . The source of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has yet not been identified and proven scientifically though several researches had been conducted for past one decade and more by various research scholars and scientists. Several reports (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020; WHO, 2020) claims that the source of the infection of the COVID-19 comes from wild animals. Indeed, majority of the research works indicate that, it is most analogous to a corona virus family isolated from bats and the transitional host may be pangolin, yet it is still uncertain that which kind of wild animal may be the source.\\nAs stated above, the human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus is mainly caused by respiratory droplets, physical touch of the infected areas and close contact with the infected persons.\\nFrom the clinical reports from various regions, it is evident that the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus might be from 3-14 days and also it is infectious even during the incubation period, which is the serious cause of the increased number of infections emerging around the globe.\\nIn spite of the nation's considerable effects on public health and increased understanding of the process by which the infections emerge, no pandemic has been forecasted before infecting human beings.\\nPreviously, reports have been reviewed about what is known about the pathogens that emerge, the hosts from which the specific infections originate in, and the factors that drive their transmission (Stephen, S Morse., Jonna, A. K. Mazet., Mark, Woolhouse., Colin, R. Parrish., Dennis, Carroll., William, B. Karesh., Carlos, Zambrana-Torrelio., 2012). On the one hand, various epidemiologist have discussed the challenges to control their spread and new efforts to predict pandemics and identify prevention strategies (Ogden, Nicholas H., Fazil, Aamir., Safronetz, David., Drebot, Michael A., Wallace, Justine., Rees, Erin E., Decock, Kristina., Ng, Victoria., 2017) . Apparently, having such innovative technologies and .

The possibility of infection in Tamil Nadu (TN) region also depends on the total numbers of travellers and the proportions that use air travel to reach any part of Tamil Nadu region since the initial discovery of the disease. Therefore, in order to manage the risks of residents of Tamil Nadu, a modified SIER method (one of the IDM methodology) is chosen to predict the number of infected cases of COVID-19 by applying the current available data from the Ministry of Health, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nThere are extensive and eminent histories of mathematical models in epidemiology. Since the ancient times, theoretical epidemiology has been witnessing numerous developments in various directions. Some of these studies can be found in (Bailey, 1975) , (Anderson, R. M., May, R. M., 1991) and (Hethcote, 2000) . An incredible number of models have been framed, analyzed and applied to an assortment of infectious diseases qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, mathematical models have been the most significant tools in analyzing the spread and to determine the control measures of the infectious diseases.\\nAdditionally, mathematical models currently play a key role in the areas of policy making, including .

In this model the population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics (Sarah A, 2012) .\\nAs a significant element, SEIR model is presented in this paper, where there is an exposed duration between being infected and becoming infective (Incubation period). Various researches have been conducted on SEIR models which are presented in detail in (Sun, C., Hsieh, Y., 2010; Yi, N., Zhang, Q., Mao, K., Yang, D., Li, Q., 2009; Zhang, J., Li., Ma, Z., 2006; Zhou, X., Cui, J., 2011) . Treating such deadly disease such as SARS, measles, flue and tuberculosis this model played a significant role in controlling or decreasing the spread of the infections in the specified study region. More recent work on the effect of treatment on the dynamic behavior can be found in (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020; Wang, J., Liu, S., Zheng, B., Takeuchi, Y., 2012; Wendi, 2006) . Contrastingly, in traditional epidemic models, the treatment rate is presumed to be proportionate to the number of infective, which is almost not possible in reality. Therefore, in this paper assuming that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness, will not be suitable for the current situation as the COVID-19 is infectious even during its incubation period. Hence, this article first describes, 1. A modified SEIR model.\\n2. Predict and analyze the varying trend of the epidemic situation.\\nFurthermore, from outputs of the above considerations, using Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations from the model which will be based on recent public data from the Ministry of Health -Tamil Nadu and analyze the results. Also further providing recommendations for local prevention and control of the COVID-19 infectious diseases.\\nThe novel Corona virus infection when compared with SARS, the symptoms of virus infection are latent in patients which are obvious from the reports of the confirmed patients. Therefore, this quality brings great complications for the prevention and control of the epidemic. Form the various reports and analysis, one infers the classical SEIR model assumes that the infected person's incubation period is not infectious;\\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .\\nthis assumption will not be valid for this case of COVID-19 infection characteristics. Therefore, a modified or improved SEIR model is considered to analyze and predict the trend of the epidemic. The modified SEIR model is similar to the traditional SEIR model by amending the following assumptions:\\n1. The normal birth rate and mortality during the study period are not taken into account;\\n2. The influence of other peripheral factors on the model parameters is overlooked during the study period;\\n3. The transmission method is considered as from infected human-to-human.\\nFor predicting the virus infections due to human-to-human transition in the Tamil Nadu state, the total population of the state has to be divided into four categories:\\nSusceptible populations (S, not yet infected but at risk of being infected), Exposed or latent people (E, including people with mild or asymptomatic but infectious populations),\\nRecovered (R, including those who have been cured and died from COVID-19 infection).\\nThe first case of Novel Corona virus infection was found on March 7, 2020 in the State Tamil Nadu. It is reported from quarantine and clinical observations (WHO, 2020), that the average incubation period of New Corona virus infection was 7 days, so considering that, one believes that the first patient who is with infection of COVID-19 may already exist on February 29, 2020. It is said that, the infected patient has a travel history to Oman. In order to obtain a precise prediction, we have classified those who have been infected with the COVID-19 but are not diagnosed as latent human; when the latent humans are diagnosed as COVID-19 infected case, those will be treated in a special quarantine hospital. This type of conclusion will lead to the situation that, infected people will not be having the possibility of spreading and transmitting the virus to the others. For these reasons, we aim to predict the rate of infections in the south Indian region state of Tamil Nadu by using a modified SEIR model described above. The parameters of the SEIR model, which are dependent on time function ' ' and are modelled as below,\\n(1)\\n.

According to the reports from WHO (World Health Organisation) (WHO, 2020), the death rate has been estimated as 0.034 based on the upcoming clinical reports and previous incidents. Therefore, the death parameter has been formulated as below, = 0.034 * ( )\\nFurther, in this analysis, there is a consideration that the person infected with the novel Corona Virus 2019 has an incubation period during which the infected person could transmit the virus to a healthy person during this incubation period. These kinds of transmission during the incubation period have not been reported in case of Ebola or SARS viruses. Therefore, the rate of change in the states of the SIER parameter will depend on the past state and not only on the current state. Specifically, during the analysis of the modified SIER model, the present number of infections ( ( )) which depends on the time constraints is considered as two fragments. One was transferred by the human carrying the incubating COVID-19 virus and the other is the number of confirmed humans who are infected with the virus at the time interval ' '. A recent report (Qun, Li., M, Med., 2020) has assessed the incubation period and the average duration of the incubation period of the COVID-19 is reported to be 5.2 days (95 % of the Clinical Investigations are reported to be between 4.1 to 7 days) (Qun, Li., M, Med., 2020) . Therefore, in this analysis, for an efficient analysis, the incubation period has been chosen to be 7 days. Hence, from the above consideration, at a sample time ' ' an infected person who is confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 would have been exposed to the virus from a latent person before 7 days of the confirmation .

Consequently, from the assumptions made above, the modified SEIR model can be constructed using delay difference in the parameters, \\nIn this analysis, the situation which has prevailed in the Chinese city of Wuhan and the outcome reports is considered as the base model. Therefore, while mapping the analysis to Tamil Nadu, the parameters have to be assigned with the data which will be in accordance with the current statistical data of Tamil Nadu region. According to the census report 2012 of Government, the population of Tamil Nadu was officially recorded as 67.86 million. Therefore, certain projected studies reveal that the population of Tamil Nadu in 2019 was 77, 177, 540 (The Director General, 2012). Therefore, in this analysis it is assumed that N = 77, 177, 540. When a susceptible human (S) is getting contact with that latent human (E) in a unit time ' ', the susceptible human can be infected with the virus having the most probability of getting infected. As a result, that latent human becoming a possible virus carrier (E).\\nAccording to clinical investigations and official reports (WHO, 2020), from 2 % to 5 % of adjacent contacts of the infected or latent human are diagnosed as infected. Therefore, the probability of contact between a susceptible human and a latent human is from 2 % to 5 %. In this analysis we use the maximum, which is 5 % as the probability of infection ' '. The average daily number of the close contacts of the latent person is = 5. Therefore, the probability of infection ' ' is 0.25 ( = * ).\\nIn the current situation each of the exposed human (E) is transformed into an infected human (I) at a conversion rate ' ', and it is assumed from the reports (WHO, 2020) that, the incubation period refers to the duration from the infection acquired by the human to the outcome of clinical symptoms of the virus.\\nFrom the reports of WHO (WHO, 2020), COVID-19 is initially assessed to have an incubation duration of 2 to 12.5 days and a median duration of 5 to 6 days. Although, most of the recent reports (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020) indicates that, the incubation period for COVID-19 may be up to or little more than 14 days from the initial infection of the virus. Hence, WHO recommends a quarantine period of 14 days with constant follow-up of the symptoms. Therefore, in this analysis, it is assumed that .

Therefore, the conversion rate of the latent human to the infected human = 0.14 which is = 1/( ) . The probability of each infected human (I) becoming a recovered human (R) is duration of the treatment process. The treatment process can vary from each individual, but in this analysis the earliest time of recovery recorded is taken into account. It is evident from reports (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020) that, the treatment plan is premeditated to allow the infected person to continue 14 days under quarantine and attain an auto healing effect through the infected human's autoimmune mechanism. Therefore, the treatment cycle selected in this paper is 9.1 days based on the various clinical reports (WHO, 2020) and the Wuhan model, so the recovery rate is 0.11 ( = 1/9.1 = 0.11).\\nFrom the above analysed conclusions, the parameters for the modified SIER model have been assumed.\\nThe parameters ( ), ( ), ( ), and ( ) are all greater than zero. As per the ministry's report the first patient in Tamil Nadu region was found on March 7, 2020. Therefore, the first case of latency would have appeared on February 29, 2020. Now, from the above considerations February 29, 2020 is the 0th day, so the modified SIER parameters at ' = 0' will be (0) = 77, 177, 539 , (0) = 1, (0) = 0, and (0) = 0.\\nThe above formulations and parameters have been subjected to analysis by using Matlab software. The outcome of the results and its inferences are discussed in the sections below.\\nBy using Matlab software two models have been simulated. The one which is based on the real time predictions, where there are no full influential governmental policies enacted to the public and the other is, where the government has proposed various actions for the welfare of the people and to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 infections. Therefore, both the models have been simulated using Matlab and the current available data.\\n.

It can be seen from Figure 1 that the epidemic situation starts to concentrate in about 90 days. It can be seen that the number of infected people will reach its peak in about 120 days. Secondly, while considering the second case of prediction in the case of enacted governmental policies like quarantine precautions, hand sanitizing, social distancing and avoiding the crowd in public places, the Figure. 2 shows the predicted results. From the predicted results, it is obvious that, the number of infected people may reach 13, 24 and 470 only in 220 days and will eventually come to an end after 250 days from the period of initial consideration.\\n.

It is also evident from Table. 2 that, when the government adopts effective quarantine measures, the number of infected people can be drastically reduced. .

From the previous news articles and the managements reports, China's response to the epidemic can be seen in three stages: first stage is to control the primary source of infection and discard the transmission chains around all the areas in Hubei Province; second stage is to vigorously treat infected patients and reduce mortality; and the third stage is to control the epidemic condition, thoroughly contain the disease epidemic, and drastically reduce the contact ratio between human population. In this article, the path of the curve is simulated by a time-lapse modified SEIR model. The model prediction shows that without any governmental policies or control measures, the peak of infected human will reach about 25, 81, 190 when the average daily number of contacts per infected person is = 5. Therefore, it is recognised that the Tamil Nadu Government and the Ministry of Health takes strict control and precautionary measures from March 22, 2020. Hence, the number of people infected will be greatly reduced which is expected to be by the simulated model as 13, 24 and 470 of the total population of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, local government authorities and public health departments should emphasise their efforts on controlling the source of infection and delink the maximum possible transmission chains, such as increasing the sample number of testing which leads to the early detection of the infected person, screening of the latent humans which finds its way to early isolation, and early preparedness for treating the infected humans expected to come, to highly cut down the gathering of large groups of people, and to regularly and completely ban the use of public toilets and public utility areas. Importantly the policies are to me made in such a way that, it should strictly impose on the \"Three Cs\" -Closed and Crowded places and Conversations in close proximity to the public thereby creating a awareness to avoid the community transmission of the COVID-19.\\n</td>\n",

       "22  Since the Novel Corona Virus 19 was first detected in Hubei province of Chinese country in Wuhan City in late December 2019, it has been spreading rapidly across the globe (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020; Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020) . Furthermore, by the end of March 2020, COVID-19 had been detected in most of the countries globally leading a pandemic situation (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020) . Nevertheless, the COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic by The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11\\nMarch 2020.\\nSubsequently, as of 15 March 2020, 1 69 517 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide by more than 150 countries. Since late February, the majority of cases reported are from outside China, with an increasing number of these reported mainly from the USA, Italy. Spain and from most part of EU/EEA countries and the UK (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020; WHO, 2020) . As the number of infections among the globe increases, several thousands of cases are reported by EU/EEA countries to be dead due to the severe illness caused by the COVID-19 infections. Further, on March 25 th , the world report (WHO, 2020) on corona virus infections reported that, Italy represents 15 % of the infected cases (74, 386) and 35 % of the fatalities (7,503) of the total infected and dead cases reported around the globe.\\nThe current hop of the increase in cases around the EU/EEA and the UK reflects the trends which had been realised in China during the January and early February 2020. In the present situation where COVID-19 infections are hastily spreading worldwide and as initially the number of cases in Europe were rising with an increasing pace in several affected areas, but now a days due to the infected travellers moving around the globe for various activities are spreading the infections to the persons who come in near contact with the infected individuals. Due to such mass transmission of the infections, there is a need for instantaneous targeted action towards the spread of COVID-19. The speed with which COVID-19 can cause nationally devastating epidemics once transmission within the community is established (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020) which specifies that may be in a few weeks or even days, it is most likely that situations to those seen in China, USA and Italy may be seen in other states of India.\\nSignificantly, at this current situation there are no proven medicines for curing the COVID-19 or vaccines to prevent the transmission of the infections but instead there are only very few evidences on the effectiveness of potential therapeutic treatments to improve the immune system of an individual as a precaution. The clinical demonstrations of COVID-19 range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to respiratory problems and lastly to severe pneumonia; severe infections can induce multi-organ failure and lead to death (WHO, 2020) . The majority of reported cases (80%) are with milder respiratory infections and pneumonias. It is noticed that severe illness and deaths are more common among the ageing population with other chronic pre-existing conditions. These are the risk groups which are accounting for the majority of severe disease and fatalities to date (Rhonda, Sue., Roberts., Ivo, M Foppa., 2006) .\\nPreviously, several pandemics such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), Ebola, HIV/AIDS, pandemic influenza has been reported to be originated in animals which are caused by viruses, and are determined to develop by behavioural, environmental conditions, or socioeconomic fluctuations (Stephen, S Morse., Jonna, A. K. Mazet., Mark, Woolhouse., Colin, R. Parrish., Dennis, Carroll., William, B. Karesh., Carlos, Zambrana-Torrelio., 2012) . The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic was one of the most closely tracked and studied epidemics in history (Manoj, G., Catherine, B., Justin, J., Amra, U., Lucinda, E. J., Matthew, B., 2015) . The source of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has yet not been identified and proven scientifically though several researches had been conducted for past one decade and more by various research scholars and scientists. Several reports (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020; WHO, 2020) claims that the source of the infection of the COVID-19 comes from wild animals. Indeed, majority of the research works indicate that, it is most analogous to a corona virus family isolated from bats and the transitional host may be pangolin, yet it is still uncertain that which kind of wild animal may be the source.\\nAs stated above, the human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus is mainly caused by respiratory droplets, physical touch of the infected areas and close contact with the infected persons.\\nFrom the clinical reports from various regions, it is evident that the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus might be from 3-14 days and also it is infectious even during the incubation period, which is the serious cause of the increased number of infections emerging around the globe.\\nIn spite of the nation's considerable effects on public health and increased understanding of the process by which the infections emerge, no pandemic has been forecasted before infecting human beings.\\nPreviously, reports have been reviewed about what is known about the pathogens that emerge, the hosts from which the specific infections originate in, and the factors that drive their transmission (Stephen, S Morse., Jonna, A. K. Mazet., Mark, Woolhouse., Colin, R. Parrish., Dennis, Carroll., William, B. Karesh., Carlos, Zambrana-Torrelio., 2012). On the one hand, various epidemiologist have discussed the challenges to control their spread and new efforts to predict pandemics and identify prevention strategies (Ogden, Nicholas H., Fazil, Aamir., Safronetz, David., Drebot, Michael A., Wallace, Justine., Rees, Erin E., Decock, Kristina., Ng, Victoria., 2017) . Apparently, having such innovative technologies and .

The possibility of infection in Tamil Nadu (TN) region also depends on the total numbers of travellers and the proportions that use air travel to reach any part of Tamil Nadu region since the initial discovery of the disease. Therefore, in order to manage the risks of residents of Tamil Nadu, a modified SIER method (one of the IDM methodology) is chosen to predict the number of infected cases of COVID-19 by applying the current available data from the Ministry of Health, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nThere are extensive and eminent histories of mathematical models in epidemiology. Since the ancient times, theoretical epidemiology has been witnessing numerous developments in various directions. Some of these studies can be found in (Bailey, 1975) , (Anderson, R. M., May, R. M., 1991) and (Hethcote, 2000) . An incredible number of models have been framed, analyzed and applied to an assortment of infectious diseases qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, mathematical models have been the most significant tools in analyzing the spread and to determine the control measures of the infectious diseases.\\nAdditionally, mathematical models currently play a key role in the areas of policy making, including .

In this model the population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics (Sarah A, 2012) .\\nAs a significant element, SEIR model is presented in this paper, where there is an exposed duration between being infected and becoming infective (Incubation period). Various researches have been conducted on SEIR models which are presented in detail in (Sun, C., Hsieh, Y., 2010; Yi, N., Zhang, Q., Mao, K., Yang, D., Li, Q., 2009; Zhang, J., Li., Ma, Z., 2006; Zhou, X., Cui, J., 2011) . Treating such deadly disease such as SARS, measles, flue and tuberculosis this model played a significant role in controlling or decreasing the spread of the infections in the specified study region. More recent work on the effect of treatment on the dynamic behavior can be found in (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020; Wang, J., Liu, S., Zheng, B., Takeuchi, Y., 2012; Wendi, 2006) . Contrastingly, in traditional epidemic models, the treatment rate is presumed to be proportionate to the number of infective, which is almost not possible in reality. Therefore, in this paper assuming that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness, will not be suitable for the current situation as the COVID-19 is infectious even during its incubation period. Hence, this article first describes, 1. A modified SEIR model.\\n2. Predict and analyze the varying trend of the epidemic situation.\\nFurthermore, from outputs of the above considerations, using Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations from the model which will be based on recent public data from the Ministry of Health -Tamil Nadu and analyze the results. Also further providing recommendations for local prevention and control of the COVID-19 infectious diseases.\\nThe novel Corona virus infection when compared with SARS, the symptoms of virus infection are latent in patients which are obvious from the reports of the confirmed patients. Therefore, this quality brings great complications for the prevention and control of the epidemic. Form the various reports and analysis, one infers the classical SEIR model assumes that the infected person's incubation period is not infectious;\\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .\\nthis assumption will not be valid for this case of COVID-19 infection characteristics. Therefore, a modified or improved SEIR model is considered to analyze and predict the trend of the epidemic. The modified SEIR model is similar to the traditional SEIR model by amending the following assumptions:\\n1. The normal birth rate and mortality during the study period are not taken into account;\\n2. The influence of other peripheral factors on the model parameters is overlooked during the study period;\\n3. The transmission method is considered as from infected human-to-human.\\nFor predicting the virus infections due to human-to-human transition in the Tamil Nadu state, the total population of the state has to be divided into four categories:\\nSusceptible populations (S, not yet infected but at risk of being infected), Exposed or latent people (E, including people with mild or asymptomatic but infectious populations),\\nRecovered (R, including those who have been cured and died from COVID-19 infection).\\nThe first case of Novel Corona virus infection was found on March 7, 2020 in the State Tamil Nadu. It is reported from quarantine and clinical observations (WHO, 2020), that the average incubation period of New Corona virus infection was 7 days, so considering that, one believes that the first patient who is with infection of COVID-19 may already exist on February 29, 2020. It is said that, the infected patient has a travel history to Oman. In order to obtain a precise prediction, we have classified those who have been infected with the COVID-19 but are not diagnosed as latent human; when the latent humans are diagnosed as COVID-19 infected case, those will be treated in a special quarantine hospital. This type of conclusion will lead to the situation that, infected people will not be having the possibility of spreading and transmitting the virus to the others. For these reasons, we aim to predict the rate of infections in the south Indian region state of Tamil Nadu by using a modified SEIR model described above. The parameters of the SEIR model, which are dependent on time function ' ' and are modelled as below,\\n(1)\\n.

According to the reports from WHO (World Health Organisation) (WHO, 2020), the death rate has been estimated as 0.034 based on the upcoming clinical reports and previous incidents. Therefore, the death parameter has been formulated as below, = 0.034 * ( )\\nFurther, in this analysis, there is a consideration that the person infected with the novel Corona Virus 2019 has an incubation period during which the infected person could transmit the virus to a healthy person during this incubation period. These kinds of transmission during the incubation period have not been reported in case of Ebola or SARS viruses. Therefore, the rate of change in the states of the SIER parameter will depend on the past state and not only on the current state. Specifically, during the analysis of the modified SIER model, the present number of infections ( ( )) which depends on the time constraints is considered as two fragments. One was transferred by the human carrying the incubating COVID-19 virus and the other is the number of confirmed humans who are infected with the virus at the time interval ' '. A recent report (Qun, Li., M, Med., 2020) has assessed the incubation period and the average duration of the incubation period of the COVID-19 is reported to be 5.2 days (95 % of the Clinical Investigations are reported to be between 4.1 to 7 days) (Qun, Li., M, Med., 2020) . Therefore, in this analysis, for an efficient analysis, the incubation period has been chosen to be 7 days. Hence, from the above consideration, at a sample time ' ' an infected person who is confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 would have been exposed to the virus from a latent person before 7 days of the confirmation .

Consequently, from the assumptions made above, the modified SEIR model can be constructed using delay difference in the parameters, \\nIn this analysis, the situation which has prevailed in the Chinese city of Wuhan and the outcome reports is considered as the base model. Therefore, while mapping the analysis to Tamil Nadu, the parameters have to be assigned with the data which will be in accordance with the current statistical data of Tamil Nadu region. According to the census report 2012 of Government, the population of Tamil Nadu was officially recorded as 67.86 million. Therefore, certain projected studies reveal that the population of Tamil Nadu in 2019 was 77, 177, 540 (The Director General, 2012). Therefore, in this analysis it is assumed that N = 77, 177, 540. When a susceptible human (S) is getting contact with that latent human (E) in a unit time ' ', the susceptible human can be infected with the virus having the most probability of getting infected. As a result, that latent human becoming a possible virus carrier (E).\\nAccording to clinical investigations and official reports (WHO, 2020), from 2 % to 5 % of adjacent contacts of the infected or latent human are diagnosed as infected. Therefore, the probability of contact between a susceptible human and a latent human is from 2 % to 5 %. In this analysis we use the maximum, which is 5 % as the probability of infection ' '. The average daily number of the close contacts of the latent person is = 5. Therefore, the probability of infection ' ' is 0.25 ( = * ).\\nIn the current situation each of the exposed human (E) is transformed into an infected human (I) at a conversion rate ' ', and it is assumed from the reports (WHO, 2020) that, the incubation period refers to the duration from the infection acquired by the human to the outcome of clinical symptoms of the virus.\\nFrom the reports of WHO (WHO, 2020), COVID-19 is initially assessed to have an incubation duration of 2 to 12.5 days and a median duration of 5 to 6 days. Although, most of the recent reports (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020) indicates that, the incubation period for COVID-19 may be up to or little more than 14 days from the initial infection of the virus. Hence, WHO recommends a quarantine period of 14 days with constant follow-up of the symptoms. Therefore, in this analysis, it is assumed that . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .\\nthe incubation period is a maximum 7 days. Therefore, the conversion rate of the latent human to the infected human = 0.14 which is = 1/( ) . The probability of each infected human (I) becoming a recovered human (R) is duration of the treatment process. The treatment process can vary from each individual, but in this analysis the earliest time of recovery recorded is taken into account. It is evident from reports (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020) that, the treatment plan is premeditated to allow the infected person to continue 14 days under quarantine and attain an auto healing effect through the infected human's autoimmune mechanism. Therefore, the treatment cycle selected in this paper is 9.1 days based on the various clinical reports (WHO, 2020) and the Wuhan model, so the recovery rate is 0.11 ( = 1/9.1 = 0.11).\\nFrom the above analysed conclusions, the parameters for the modified SIER model have been assumed.\\nThe parameters ( ), ( ), ( ), and ( ) are all greater than zero. As per the ministry's report the first patient in Tamil Nadu region was found on March 7, 2020. Therefore, the first case of latency would have appeared on February 29, 2020. Now, from the above considerations February 29, 2020 is the 0th day, so the modified SIER parameters at ' = 0' will be (0) = 77, 177, 539 , (0) = 1, (0) = 0, and (0) = 0.\\nThe above formulations and parameters have been subjected to analysis by using Matlab software. The outcome of the results and its inferences are discussed in the sections below.\\nBy using Matlab software two models have been simulated. The one which is based on the real time predictions, where there are no full influential governmental policies enacted to the public and the other is, where the government has proposed various actions for the welfare of the people and to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 infections. Therefore, both the models have been simulated using Matlab and the current available data.\\n.

It can be seen from Figure 1 that the epidemic situation starts to concentrate in about 90 days. It can be seen that the number of infected people will reach its peak in about 120 days. Secondly, while considering the second case of prediction in the case of enacted governmental policies like quarantine precautions, hand sanitizing, social distancing and avoiding the crowd in public places, the Figure. 2 shows the predicted results. From the predicted results, it is obvious that, the number of infected people may reach 13, 24 and 470 only in 220 days and will eventually come to an end after 250 days from the period of initial consideration.\\n.

It is also evident from Table. 2 that, when the government adopts effective quarantine measures, the number of infected people can be drastically reduced. .

From the previous news articles and the managements reports, China's response to the epidemic can be seen in three stages: first stage is to control the primary source of infection and discard the transmission chains around all the areas in Hubei Province; second stage is to vigorously treat infected patients and reduce mortality; and the third stage is to control the epidemic condition, thoroughly contain the disease epidemic, and drastically reduce the contact ratio between human population. In this article, the path of the curve is simulated by a time-lapse modified SEIR model. The model prediction shows that without any governmental policies or control measures, the peak of infected human will reach about 25, 81, 190 when the average daily number of contacts per infected person is = 5. Therefore, it is recognised that the Tamil Nadu Government and the Ministry of Health takes strict control and precautionary measures from March 22, 2020. Hence, the number of people infected will be greatly reduced which is expected to be by the simulated model as 13, 24 and 470 of the total population of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, local government authorities and public health departments should emphasise their efforts on controlling the source of infection and delink the maximum possible transmission chains, such as increasing the sample number of testing which leads to the early detection of the infected person, screening of the latent humans which finds its way to early isolation, and early preparedness for treating the infected humans expected to come, to highly cut down the gathering of large groups of people, and to regularly and completely ban the use of public toilets and public utility areas. Importantly the policies are to me made in such a way that, it should strictly impose on the \"Three Cs\" -Closed and Crowded places and Conversations in close proximity to the public thereby creating a awareness to avoid the community transmission of the COVID-19.\\n  "

Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function.

The 5′ UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.\\nMoreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).\\nThe presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication.

       "      <td>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 , which by March 2020 has already spread across more than 80 countries 1 . Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia, often resulting in death 2 . Soon after the first epidemiological data together with SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were made available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries.\\nDespite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. In particular, the US-based NextStrain 3 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford, UK, among others. Recently, an editorial published on Science 6 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data.\\nHence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed.\\n.

We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences deposited on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population ( Figure 1 ). As March 10 th 2020, 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available, almost twice as much than just one week earlier (March 3 rd 2020, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries). Yet, the sampling per country was inhomogeneous, with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes (Spearman correlation = 0.03). Moreover, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country.\\nItaly, for example, the second country per confirmed cases, has uploaded so far only two genomes from Lombardy and three from Lazio (Table S1) , i.e. only two of the twenty Italian regions, all with confirmed cases 9 . China and USA contributed with 123 and 63 genomes respectively (56% combined), while 13 countries contribute with only one or two samples (6.3% combined). Notably, three countries with less than 400 confirmed cases have provided a substantial number of genomes (Netherlands 28, Australia 18, Singapore 11; 17% combined) ( Figure 1 ).\\nThe effect of inhomogeneous sampling and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions, like the ones recently rushed through news and (social) media to claim specific dissemination routes of SARS-CoV-2 among countries, can be quite dramatic. An instructive example is the putative introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy from Germany. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree, inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on March 3 rd , 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1 ), showed a well-supported cluster of European and Asian sequences (reported in Figure 2a ), which contained a subclade (subclade A, Figure 2a ) including a sequence isolated in Germany that .

However, in a new tree inferred just one week later, when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on GISAID 8 ( Figure S2 ), the direct link between Germany and Italy has disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from Portugal, Brazil, Wales and Netherland ( Figure 2b ). Most importantly, there is no sufficient evidence of a higher likelihood (Shimodaira-Hasgawa test, Table 1 ) for tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree (see arrows in Figure 2b) compared to the ML tree inferred from the real data. In other words, it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern (and, therefore, phylogeographic reconstruction)\\nis the most likely.\\nLack of resolution and uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected, considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic, even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving RNA virus. Plots of pairwise transitions/transversions vs. genetic distance 10 showed, indeed, low genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes, considerable scattering, and overlap in transitions and transversions among closely related sequences (Figure 3a ). The 331 full genomes available contained 477 out of 29,564 variable sites (1.6%), of which 377 were singleton and only 100 (0.34%) parsimony informative, indicating a substantial lack of phylogenetic information, and raising the possibility of a number of sequencing errors. Further assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11 , which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences (quartet), randomly .

Quartets are considered \"resolved\" when the three likelihoods are significantly different (phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e. data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include &lt;40% of the unresolved quartets 12 , way lower than the 52.9% unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment ( Figure 3b ). It is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any SARS-CoV-2 tree unreliable, and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution. Finally, the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ML tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal (no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time, Figure 3c ). This is, again, expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak. Bayesian analysis 13 , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate. With more genome sequences sampled from different time points and geographic areas made available, literally, every day, Bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option. However, as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable.\\nTaken together, our observations suggest that any conclusion drawn, at present, about existing lineages and direction of viral spread, based on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, is potentially misleading. Nowadays, published scientific data and media are very easily .

We believe that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Any inference based on phylogenetic trees should be considered at the very best preliminary, and hypothesis-generating.\\nHence the need for 1) avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and 2) continuing the concerted scientific effort to increase the number and quality of available data. The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread will unveil an unprecedented amount of information, which is essential to make policy decisions. The whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic, and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing. Some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant, high quality sequence data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases, such as Italy and South Korea, but also from others that seem to be experiencing, at least for now, a lower number of infections.\\nGISAID was accessed on March 3 rd and 10 th , 2020 (final dataset information reported in Table   S1 ). After quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides, the first dataset (March 3 rd 2020) consisted of 169 genomes from 22 countries, while the second (March 10 th , 2020) 331 from 29 countries.

       "      <td>The 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread across China and 24 other countries 1-3 as of February 8, 2020 . The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.\\nHealthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.\\nThis study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.\\nRecent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.\\nThe Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .\\nThe ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.\\nThe reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>[{'text': 'The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]</td>\n",
       "      <td>The outbreak of infectious diseases has always been one of the most important health problems in the world. With the rapid spread of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , much attention has been paid to subjects like rate of an epidemic, transition ways, prevention methods, and remaining time of the virus in the environment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, the behavior of the virus in relation to environmental factors is critical. The coronavirus is one of the epidemic diseases that many countries have experienced in the new type of it, COVID-19, and can become a serious challenge and affect the previous efforts on sustainable development [6] [7] [8] [9] .\\nIt has been found that there are some delays between the detection of confirmed cases and the actual infection date due to the laboratory test, the time of the announcement of confirmed cases in media, and the time for the patients showing initial symptoms for a total usually of 3 to 5 days [10] [11] [12] . The analysis of Kampf et al. (2020) demonstrated that COVID-19 could remain up to 9 days on different materials based on temperature and humidity [13] . Cascella et al. (2020) conducted research on the new coronavirus structure. Their analysis shows that the virus belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ ssRNA), which has a length of about 30 kb and an envelope with spear structures and they tested the sensitivity of the virus to UV and temperature [14] . investigated the correlations between environmental factors and the number of positive cases of COVID-19 by the use of artificial intelligence techniques. The results of this study put evidence on the role of urban and weather conditions on the epidemic rate [15] . Chen et al. (2020) developed a time-dependent mathematical model for the prediction of the total number of positive cases [16] . Lytle and Sagripanti (2005) studied the impact of UV rays, and their results determined that it can affect the structure of coronaviruses because UV rays could damage the nucleic acids of viral RNA that is vital for the survival of the virus [17] . developed an assessment method for investigating the impact of climate and urban factors in confirmed cases of COVID-19 [18] . Bukhari et al., (2020) , studied the epidemic of COVID-19 on tropical zones and their results show that the highest number of infection happened in temperature among 3 to 17 ºC [19] .\\nThe analysis of Grant and Giovannucci (2009) shows that by increasing the UV, the level of vitamin D in the body increases and makes the infection rates decrease. Therefore, in areas on lower latitudes and closer to the equator line, the epidemic on COVID-19 might be different [20] . In the study of Chan et al. (2011) , the effect of temperature and humidity on SARS coronavirus was analyzed, and they found that increasing temperature decreases the epidemic rate by faster disabling virus structure on contaminated surfaces [21] . Pirouz and Violini (2020) , analyzed the outbreak patterns of COVID-19 by analysis of 117 countries. They suggested two mechanisms of triggering the development of the infection, namely the normal spread of an infection from one parent case and the consequence of a unique phenomenon of accumulation of contagious people [22] . Analysis of the previous studies demonstrates the necessity of further research about the effect of environmental factors on the COVID-19. Since some of the previous researches have shown the effect of weather conditions, especially temperature, on coronavirus viruses, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the better correlation of daily mean air temperature on the epidemic rate of the COVID-19.\\nIn this study, we analysed the number of positive contagions of coronavirus COVID-19, from February 29 th to March 19 th . The selection of February 29 th is due to existence on this date of at least one positive case of COVID-19 in all case studies studied. The analysis of the weather data started from February15 th and ended on March 18 th because the impact of the weather parameter would occur in the upcoming days. Thus, the considered average daily temperature is with an interval of 1 to 14 days before the definitive cases of COVID-19.\\n In order to minimize the impact of other parameters on the results, such as the policy of each government, cultural differences between countries, health care systems, or the protocols in getting coronavirus test, comparative analysis have been done for different regions of the same country, without comparing with each other the results of different countries;  The analysis period for average daily temperature ranges from February15 th , 2020 to March18 th , 2020 (33 days);  The analysis period for confirmed cases of coronavirus COVID-19 is from February 29 th to March19 th ;  For what concerns the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, the total number of confirmed cases in a region was divided into the population of that region in order to take into account the different size of the population in each region.\\nTo carry out the analysis, the datasets of five countries and in each country, of three regions/provinces have been considered. The selected case studies are presented in Table 1 . and the location of the three regions shown in Figures 1. \\nMathematical models have been successfully used for the analysis of many hazards [32, 33] . In complex subjects, different Mathematical models can be used to solve the problem [34] [35] [36] . Statistical tests are an appropriate method for the investigation of possible correlations between different datasets [37] . Many statistical tests can be used for the analysis of significant differences between the datasets, among which F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test [38] .\\nIn order to investigate the hypothesis about a correlation between significant differences (Sig.) of average daily temperatures and average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases in two regions, the following assumptions, and statistical tests have been done:\\n The variances of the two groups are equal: H0  The variances of the two groups are not equal: H1\\n.

Conversely, if the significance level (sig.) is larger than 0.05, the hypothesis H1 is rejected, and the hypothesis H0 is accepted, i.e., the variances of the datasets in the two selected regions are equal.\\nThrough F-test, one determines the presence or absence of differences in the variances of the two regions. Through another statistical test, the Independent-Samples T-Test, one can determine whether the difference is significant, has been used. When using Independent-Samples T-Test, a significance level (sig.) lower (higher) than 0.05, means that the difference is (is not) significant.\\nIn our analysis, we used SPSS software. The critical factors in the SPSS Model set up are as follow:\\n The datasets in different regions of the same countries were analyzed with respect to the average daily air temperature during the 33-day period from 15-Feb to 18-Mar and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the 19 days from 29-Feb to 19-Mar.  In all statistical tests, the confidence level of 95% is considered.  First, the F-test was used to test whether there is a significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies, and then, depending on the F-test result, by the T-Test the existence of a significant difference between the data of the two cases was investigated.\\nThe average daily temperature [39, 40] , and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases [41] , are shown in Figures 2 to 6.\\na. Average daily temperature b. Cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases Correlations between the average temperatures and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases were found especially for towns with significant differences, with respect to the other two towns of the same country, in the average daily temperature. This was the case for Bandar Abas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. The average daily temperature and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases are listed in Table 2 . As a general feature of Table 2 , we notice that  In 11 out of the possible fifteen comparisons, the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is higher when the average daily temperature is lower, and in the four remaining cases the differences in either variable are small.\\nA more specific analysis per country shows that  In Iran, the average daily temperature in Bandar Abbas was the highest (21.54 ºC), and the average cumulative rate of daily of confirmed cases was the lowest (0.000027). .

However, the comparison of Santa Cruz with higher average daily temperatures shows a slower spread of COVID-19.  In the United States, the average daily air temperature in both New York and Seattle are lower than Los Angeles, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases shows the spread of the virus in both is faster than in Los Angeles.\\nThese qualitative results reflect in the statistical analysis of the data by F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test presented in Table 3 .

From the F-test, the F value is equal to 20.4. The criterion for variance equality in the F-test is that the F value must smaller than the critical F value. The statistical analysis has been done on a statistical confidence level of 95%, and therefore the error level is 0.05, and considering the degrees of freedom, the critical F value of the test that can be found through F distribution tables [42] , in this case, is equal to F = 1.57. Since the F value we found is 20.4, larger than the critical F value, the assumption of the equality of variances is rejected. It means that the average temperature variance of the Ramsar and Tehran are not equal.\\nAccording to the t-test, the t value for these two cities is equal to -1.929. Based on an error level of 0.05 and by considering the degrees of freedom, the critical values of the test indicated in the T distribution tables [43] , is in this case equal to t = ± 1.645. Since the t value is out of the critical boundary (-1.645 ≤ acceptable t ≤ +1.645), the assumption of equality in the averages is rejected, and the existence of difference in averages is confirmed. Thus from two tests, it is evident that there is a significant difference between the average temperature of the two cities of Ramsar and Tehran.\\nAn analogous result holds for the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.\\nThe main results of Table 4 , with a confidence level of 95% are as follow:\\n In Iran, the city of Bandar Abbas is significantly different from Ramsar and Tehran in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.  In Italy, the city of Milan is significantly different from Rome and Naples in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases. Instead, the two cities of Rome and Napoli are not significantly different in terms of these variables.  In Germany, there are no significant differences in average daily temperature in all three cities, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different.  In Spain, Barcelona and Valencia are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different. However, in Barcelona and Santa Cruz, the average daily temperature is significantly different, as well as the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, and the same trend exists between Valencia and Santa Cruz.  In the United States, the two cities of New York and Seattle are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and of the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, the number of patients is not significantly different. Instead, the city of Los Angeles is significantly different in terms of average daily temperature with two cities of New York and Seattle, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases are different significantly.\\nThe results of our analysis of daily air temperature for three case studies from five countries showed the existence of correlations between the average temperatures and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when the differences in average daily temperature are larger. For example, in Iran and Italy, the regions with lower average daily temperature had a higher epidemic level of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , and the same trend exists in all other case studies.\\nThe statistical analysis showed that in all the case studies we considered, referring to five different countries, if there is a significant difference in daily mean temperature, there is also a significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, supporting the proposed research hypothesis about the correlation between air temperature and the epidemic rates of COVID-19. Due to the correlations among temperature and hours of sunshine for future research, it is recommended to study the effects of the sun's UV rays as well as the average hours of sunshine on the epidemic rates of COVID-19.\\nThis study analyzed the possible correlation of daily average air temperature with the epidemic rate of the coronavirus (COVID-19) using significant differences analysis between the datasets. The research hypothesis is that in regions with a significant difference in the average daily temperature, the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases would also is different significantly. Conversely, to the absence of a significant difference in daily temperature, would correspond no significant difference in the rate of confirmed cases. The hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately. This comparison using statistical analysis through F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test of the daily temperatures and daily rate of confirmed cases shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.\\n.

In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species.

       "      <td>Metagenomic sequencing, which allows us to directly obtain total genomic DNAs from host-associated and environmental samples, has led to important findings in many areas, such as digestive health [1] . While bacteria are the main focus of most metagenomic sequencing projects, there are fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data with sequencing viruses as the main purpose [2] . There are different types of viruses. We are mainly concerned with RNA viruses because many RNA viruses are notorious human pathogens, such as Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, SARS-CoV, and recently identified 2019-nCoV causing Wuhan pneumonia. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. This high genetic diversity within and across different hosts poses a great challenge for designing long-term protection strategies against these infectious diseases. For example, as the circulating strains can change every year, flu vaccine has to be administered every year.\\nAdvances in viral metagenomics have contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. According to a survey by Woolhouse et. al, the number of newly identified RNA viruses is changing from 1,899 in 2005 to 5,561 in 2018, which is 3 times of increase [3] . Largescale RNA virus sequencing projects using nextgeneration sequencing technologies have been conducted for different species. For example, Shi et al. have discovered a large number of new RNA viruses by sequencing samples from invertebrate and vertebrate animals [4, 5] . Claire et al. have discovered 25 new RNA viruses by sequencing samples associated with different drosophilid [6] . Bolduc et al. sequenced RNA viruses from Archaeal and bacterial samples [7] . Given fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data and expected discovery of new viruses, a key step is to conduct composition analysis for these data and assign taxonomic groups for possibly new species.\\nComposition analysis can be conducted at the read level or contig level. There is no doubt that contigs can provide more information than short reads in taxonomic classification. However, metagenomic assembly is still one of the most challenging computational problems in bioinformatics. Unlike single genome assembly, metagenomic assembly is more likely to produce chimeric contigs that can contain regions from different species. Thus, metagenomic assembly is often preceded by read binning that groups reads with the same or similar taxonomic labels [8] in order to achieve better performance.\\nIn this work, we design a read level taxonomic classification tool (named as \"CHEER\") for labeling new species in viral metagenomic data. To detect known species with available reference genomes, alignment-based methods can provide sufficient information for both classification and abundance estimation. This function has been incorporated in existing pipelines [9, 10, 11] and is thus not the focus of our tool. Instead, our tool is designed to handle the challenging cases of assigning taxonomic labels for reads of new species, which have not been observed before. This problem was clearly formulated in metagenomic phylogenetic classification tools such as Phymm and PhymmBL [8] . We first define the classification problem following the formulation in Phymm: the classification problem is the assignment of a phylogenetic group label to each read in input data sets. As we are only interested in the hard case of classifying reads of new species, which have not been sequenced and thus no label exists for these species, the expected labels for these reads are the higher-rank taxonomic groups such as genus, family, or order. All our data and experiments are designed so that the test species are masked in the reference database and the trained models.\\nPrevious experiments have shown that nucleotide-level homology search is not sensitive enough for assigning higher rank taxonomic groups to reads from new species [9, 10] . Protein-based homology search is thus preferred for phylogenetic classification [11, 12] . In particular, a recent tool, VirusSeeker [13] utilized BLASTx to classify reads into bacteria, phages, and other viruses. It is not clear whether the protein homology search is able to generate accurate classification at lower ranks. We will evaluate this in our experiments.\\nThere are also alignment-free methods for phylogenetic classification. Many of those tools implemented different machine learning models and were mainly designed for bacteria. For example, RDP [14] adopted a Naïve Bayes based classifier that can automatically learn features from the reads and assigned taxonomic labels to sequences from bacterial and archaeal 16S genes and fungal 28S genes. The NBC classifier [15, 16] encoded metagenomic reads using k-mers and implemented a bag-of-word model to achieve the readlevel taxonomic classification. Phymm [8] utilized interpolated Markov models (IMMs) for metagenomic read classification. These learning-based models enable users to label reads originating from new species.\\nThe previous works have shown that sequence composition is still an important and informative feature for phylogenetic classification. Recent applications of deep learning models have achieved better performance than conventional machine learning methods in different sequence classification problems [17] . In particular, the convolution filters in Convolutional Neural Network models (CNN) can represent degenerated sequence motifs and thus help CNN models to learn abstract composition-based features. For example, frequently activated convolution filters learned by DeepFam often represented the conserved motifs in different protein domain families [18] . The successful applications of deep learning in sequence classification motivated us to design a novel deep learning-based classification model for assigning taxonomic groups for new species in viral metagenomic data.\\nOur main contributions are summarized below. First, our deep learning model can assign higher rank phylogenetic group labels (such as genus) for reads from new species. To achieve this goal, our model organizes multiple CNN-based classifiers in a tree for hierarchical taxonomic group assignment. Second, to enable our model to capture as much information as possible from short reads, we implemented and compared two encoding methods: one hot vs. embedding. Third, as viral metagenomic data usually contains contaminations from either the host genomes or other microbes, we formulated the pre-processing step as an open set problem in targeted image classification and rejected non-viral reads by choosing appropriate negative training sets. We tested our model on both simulated metagenomic data and also real sequencing data. The results show that our model competes favorably with other popular methods.\\nIn this section, we will introduce our method for viral metagenomic taxonomic classification. First, we will show the architecture of CHEER, which is a hierarchical classification model from order to genus. Second, classifiers at each level will be described. Third, we will introduce DNA sequence encoding using skipgram based word embedding and compare it with onehot encoding. Forth, we will describe the rejection layer, following the idea of the open set problem, which is adopted to filter reads not belonging to RNA viruses. Finally, we will detail our dataset used in training and validation.\\nThe architecture of our model is sketched in Fig. 1. The key component is a tree model that consists of multiple classifiers from order to genus. In order to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species, or even new genus, our classification is conducted using a top-down approach from the root to the leaf node. The top layer is a trained CNN that can reject reads not belonging to RNA viruses, which is an important preprocessing step for viral metagenomic data because of the contamination from the host genome or other microbes. Then, the filtered reads (i.e. mostly RNA viral reads) will be fed into the hierarchical classification model, which is referred to as the tree model hereafter. Specifically, the order-level classifier is responsible for classifying the reads into their originating orders. Then each order has a separately trained classifier for assigning input reads to families within that order (O1 to O3 in Fig. 1 ). For all the reads assigned into one family, the family classifier (F1-F7) will assign the reads to different genus within that family. As an example, a path for classifying a read from a species in genus 7 is highlighted in Fig. 1 . CHEER also implemented early stop functions at each level for stopping the classification path at higher ranks. This function can accommodate taxonomic classification for species from new genus or even higher ranks, which is possible for RNA viruses. It is convenient to add fine-grained classifiers within each genus so that we can assign species-level labels. However, as our focus is to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species that do not have a species labels in the training data, we did not include the species-level assignment in this work.\\nAlternative designs of hierarchical classification work, like [19, 20] , either build a classifier for each taxonomic rank or build a binary classifier for each class. We implemented a structure that built just one classifier for each taxonomic rank and compared different structures' performance. According to the result shown in [Supplementary file 1], the structure shown in Fig.1 is better than one classifier per rank. Although one classifier per rank requires fewer classifiers, it needs to train many more parameters because the number of labels for each classifier increases by times. As a result, we observe overfitting more frequently.\\nEach classifier in the tree model is implemented using CNN, which has achieved superior performance in various sequence classification problems [18] . The convolution filters used in CNN resemble positionspecific weight matrix of motifs in genomic sequences. Frequently activated convolution filters can represent well-conserved motifs among sequences in the same class. Thus, a large number of convolution filters will be used in our CNN in order to learn well-conserved sequence features in different classes. Deep CNNs in fields such as computer vision often have multiple convolution layers in order to obtain more abstract features from training images. Here, we use a wide convolution design rather than a deep one, following the idea in [18] . Fig. 2 shows the classifier with the default hyper-parameters. First, reads will be encoded in matrices as input to the convolution layer using two methods. We will describe and compare these two encoding methods later in the Section 2.3. Then, multiple convolution filters of different sizes are utilized to learn the conserved sequence features. According to our empirical study, we choose 3, 7, 11, 15 as the filter sizes, with 256 filters for each size respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Max pooling is then applied to each convolution filter's output so that only the highest convolution value is kept. After the max-pooling layer, we have a 256-dimentional vector as the output of each convolution layer. We concatenate these four vectors into one 1024-dimentional vector and feed it to one fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting. The CrossEntropyLoss function supplied by Pytorch is adopted as an error estimation function. Due to the unbalanced size of each training class, we use the reciprocal of the proportion of each class as their error weight to help the model fairly learn from each class. And we utilize Adam optimizer with a 0.001 learning rate to update the parameters. The model is trained on HPCC with the 2080Ti GPU unit. \\nIn previous deep learning-based sequence classification models [21, 22] , one hot encoding was commonly adopted to convert a sequence into a matrix, which will then be used as input to convolution layers. There also exist some methods using k-mer composition [23] and frequency [15, 16] to encode the DNA sequence, similar to the bag-of-words model in the field of natural language processing. However, these k-mers representation cannot give complete sequential information about the original reads.\\nTo incorporate both the k-mer composition and also their ordering information, we build a Skip-Gram [24] based embedding layer that can learn which k-mers tend to occur close to each other. Embedding is widely used in natural language processing to learn the semantic and syntactic relationships from sentences. A neural network with one hidden layer is trained to map a word to an n-dimensional vector so that the words that usually occur together will be closer in the n-dimension space. For our DNA read classification task, k-mers are the words and the embedding layer will map proximate kmers into vectors of high similarity. The main hyper-parameter when training the skip-gram model is the size of the training context m, which defines the maximum context location at which the furthest k-mer is taken for training. Specifically, for a kmer at position i as the input to the skip-gram model, the output k-mers are its neighbors located at i+jk, where −m ≤ ≤ m. Larger m results in more training samples with a cost of training time. In our model, the default value of m is 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , we will sample 3 k-mers as our dataset at a time with the middle one as the input and the surrounding two as the output.\\nAs proven in [24] , Skip-Gram is able to automatically learn the relationship between proximate words and thus is expected to help learn the order between k-mers in genomic data. We implemented a hidden layer with 100 hidden units shown in Fig. 3 . After training the model, the co-occurrence features are embedded in the output of the hidden layer. Thus, a k-mer in a read will be represented as a 100-dimension vector, where each element in the vector is the output of the hidden unit in the hidden layer.\\nWhen we use this pre-trained embedding layer to encode the reads, we first split each read into sequential k-mers. Second, each k-mer is fed to the embedding layer and the output is a 100-dimension vector. Third, all these vectors are combined into a large matrix according to the original position of each k-mers. Finally, this matrix will be fed to the convolutional layer.\\nBased on our large-scale experiments, we found that classifiers are easy to overfit with increase of k. Thus, we choose 100-dimensional feature vectors with k being 3 as our default embedding layer parameter set based on our empirical analysis.\\nDue to the small genome size and limitations in library construction, it is not rare that many viral metagenomic datasets are still contaminated with the genomes of the host and other microbes. Viral read screening is thus a key pre-processing step before the downstream composition analysis. Specifically, our tree model should only be applied to viral reads. However, the close set nature of the classifier forces it to assign a known label to each input without being able to distinguish viral reads from others. In this work, we will reject non-viral reads by formulating it as an open set problem in targeted image classification [25] .\\nIn a majority of neural network models [26, 27] , the logit of the last layer will be fed into the SoftMax function, which takes a vector of n real numbers as input and output a normalized probability vector for all labels/classes. However, for an irrelevant input from an unknown clade, all classes in the model tend to have low probabilities and thus applying a threshold on uncertainty can be used to reject unknown classes [25] . Along with this idea, serval approaches [28, 29] have been proposed to solve the open set problem.\\nIn this work, we incorporate the pre-processing step in our hierarchical classification model by integrating a trained CNN and a SoftMax threshold. Contaminations such as bacteria will be rejected using empirically chosen SoftMax threshold τ. Our experiments show that SoftMax outputs a nearly uniform probability distribution of all labels if the input is not relevant. Thus, the SoftMax threshold τ is used to reject reads not belonging to either DNA or RNA viruses. However, using this thresholding method is not able to distinguish DNA viral reads from RNA viral reads due to their similar sequence composition. To accommodate this challenge, we designed a rejection classifier in the top layer using DNA viral reads as the negative class in the training (see Fig. 1 ).\\nAs the focus of our work is to assign labels for new species, the hierarchical classification ends at genuslevel assignment, which is conducted by the bottom layer in Fig. 1 . Given the fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data, there are cases where a new species does not belong to any existing genus and thus the label assignment should stop at the higher ranks. Thus, we allow our model to stop at a higher rank in the tree during the top-down classification. Towards this goal, we still apply SoftMax threshold in our early stop function, which stops reads from further classification by the child classifiers. This early stop function also serves as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications if the confidence is low. For example, when a read arrives, the model may be able to identify its order and family labels with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. In this case, the model should only assign order and family label to this read rather than classifying it into a potentially wrong genus. To achieve this goal, SoftMax threshold is applied for every classifier in the tree. Only reads with a score higher than the threshold will be assigned to the child class.\\nAn example of early stop is highlighted by the yellow path in Fig. 1 . The model can classify the read into order 2 (O2) and then family 4 (F4) with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to.\\nAll the viruses used in the experiments were obtained from the RefSeq in the NCBI virus database. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009001 doi: bioRxiv preprint viruses' taxonomic classification was downloaded from Virus Taxonomy 2018b Release [30] published by the International Committee on Taxonomic of Virus (ICVT). Because training deep learning classifiers required enough samples, we removed the orders with only one family, families with only one genus, and genera with less than 3 species from our dataset. Finally, there are 6 orders, 23 families, and 55 genera remained. The RefSeq genomes are available at the following URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/fi nd-data/virus. The information of the taxa can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. As CHEER conducts read-level taxonomic classification, the training is also conducted using reads. In order to train our model on each complete virus genome, we generated simulated reads by uniformly extracting substrings of 250 bp with 200bp overlaps. All these reads formed the training set so that the model can learn the features from the whole genome. The validation set, however, is generated by read simulation tool WgSim [31] with specified error rate so that we can have a better estimation of the model's performance on real sequencing data. Some existing deep learning tools for taxonomic classification, like [21, 23] , generate reads first, then randomly choose some of them as training set and others as testing set. This strategy cannot guarantee that the training and testing data sets have no overlaps from the same species. In order to test whether our model can learn the label of new species, we use test species masking in the training set. Specifically, we split our RNA virus database into two independent sets. For any test species, their reads are not used in the training data. Thus, the model will only use the knowledge of known species for the new species classification.\\nIn this section, we will first give details of the hyperparameters of CHEER. Then we present the results of applying CHEER to both simulated and mock sequencing data. For the simulated data by WgSim, we evaluated how sequencing error rate affects the performance of CHEER and compared the taxonomic classification results with state-of-the-art. For the mock data, we tested CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and its ability in distinguishing viral reads from others.\\nIn our experiments, the minimum number of species within a genus is 3. We thus constructed three test sets, each containing reads from one species that is randomly chosen from each genus. The three test sets contain three different species, respectively. In total, 165 species from 55 genera are chosen to be \"new\" species for testing and the information of these species can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nWe used WgSim to simulate reads from testing species. In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing error on CHEER, we simulated reads with an error rate of 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively. For each classifier (CNN), we computed the classification accuracy, which is defined in equation (1). To ensure that the computation of the accuracy is not affected by the number of reads from different species, we constructed a balanced test read set by simulating the same number of reads for each test species (1,000 reads for each). (1) For each component classifier in the tree model, we record the average accuracy for multiple test species. For each taxa level, we calculate the average accuracy of all the classifiers in the same level.\\nWe present the results of CHEER at each level in this section. Because CHEER is designed for new species, we benchmark it against alignment-free models. Based on the results shown by Wood et al. [7] , Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) outperformed other alignment-free models. Thus, we compared the performance of CHEER and NBC. NBC in [14] was designed for bacteria taxonomic classification and thus, we retrained NBC on our RNA virus dataset. We implemented the NBC model following [14] with the same parameters. Since each family has a separately trained classifier, which conducts genus classification within that family, there are totally 14 classifiers at this level. Fig. 5 shows the accuracy for labeling families. There are totally 6 classifiers that assign reads to families within each of the 6 orders. Fig. 6 shows the mean accuracy at each rank. The family and genus level accuracy are the average accuracy of all classifiers in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . There is only one classifier for order level classification.\\nAs shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 , CHEER has better performance than NBC across different ranks. We also compared the performance of using one-hot encoding and embedding layer in CHEER. The performance comparison at each rank shows that for most of the classifiers, the embedding layer improves the learning ability. Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 also revealed the robustness of CHEER. Although the classification accuracy decreases as the error rate increases, the decrease is smaller than 2%. The accuracy is almost identical for many classifiers. Thus, CHEER is not very sensitive to sequencing errors. We also conducted experiments for reads with higher error rates (0.02 and 0.05). The results can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nThe next experiment is to evaluate our model on a real sequencing dataset and test CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and non-viral read rejection. We built a mock dataset by mixing Ebolavirus reads with gut bacterial reads from a gut amplicon sequencing dataset, which is chosen to ensure that we only use reads from bacteria. The taxonomic classification of Zaire Ebolavirus in the tree model is highlighted in Fig. 7 . We chose one of the Ebola species named Zaire Ebolavirus as our testing species because it is the most dangerous of the five Ebolavirus species and was responsible for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We downloaded the dataset from NCBI with accession number SRR1930021. These reads were sequenced by Illumina using whole-genome amplification strategy. Since Zaire Ebolavirus usually causes fatal hemorrhagic fever and abdominal pain, it is possible that this Ebola virus occurs with other gut bacteria. Thus, we created a mock viral metagenomic data by mixing these Ebola reads with a gut bacteria amplicon sequencing data in order to test whether CHEER can reject the bacterial reads at the top rejection layer. The gut bacteria dataset is downloaded from NCBI with accession number: SRR10714026. There are totally 2,737 Ebola virus reads and 51,280 gut bacterial reads in the mock data. After the rejection layer, the Ebola reads will be used to evaluate our tree model.\\nTo treat Zaire Ebolavirus as a \"new\" species, we removed its genome from our training set and re-trained the whole pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7 , after removing this species, we still have four Ebola species in our training set. However, our read mapping experiment using Bowtie2 [32] showed that none of the reads from Zaire Ebolavirus can be mapped to other Ebola species with the default parameters, indicating that using usual alignment-based methods will have difficulty to conduct genus-level assignment.\\nIn our work, CHEER will first use rejection layer to remove the reads not belonging to the RNA virus. Second, the \"Order classifier\" will be applied to evaluate how many reads can be classified into Mononegavirales order. Third, \"Mononegavirales classifier\" takes all these Mononegavirales reads as input to predict how many reads will be assigned to the Filoviridae family. Finally, \"Filoviridae classifier\" is adopted to check how many reads belong to the Ebola genus. Fig. 8 show the ROC curve of the rejection layer. True positive rate reveals how many Ebolavirus reads pass the rejection layer. The false positive rate reveals how many gut bacterial reads pass the rejection layer. We generated thresholds from 0 to 1 with step size 0.01 and used each threshold for the rejection layer. Then for each threshold, we recorded the true positive rate and false positive rate for plotting the ROC curve. As shown in Fig. 8 , with the increase of the threshold, more bacterial reads are filtered by the rejection layer, at the expense of missing more real Ebola reads. The default threshold for the rejection layer is 0.6 in CHEER. User can adjust the threshold according to their needs.\\nAfter evaluating the rejection layer, we continued to test the hierarchical classification performance at each rank. We first compared our tree model with NBC. Then we also benchmarked CHEER with the method using protein-level alignment in Section 3.3.3. The performance of the complete hierarchical classification pipeline of NBC and CHEER is shown in Fig. 9 . From order to genus, each bar shows the accuracy of correctly classified reads by the parent classifier. For example, NBC correctly classified 1580 at the order level. Then, 1564 out of the 1580 reads are correctly labeled at the family level. While Fig. 4 , 5, and 6 have shown the performance of CHEER and NBC at each taxonomic rank using the same set of reads as input for each level of classifiers, this experiment focused on comparing the hierarchical classification pipeline using only correctly predicted reads by the parent classifier. The results demonstrated that CHEER can classify Ebola reads with better performance. NBC can only classify 1,564 (57.1%) reads into Ebolavirus. CHEER, however, had totally 2407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly.\\nAlthough nucleotide-level alignment models are not ideal choices for predicting new species, as mentioned in [8] , protein-level alignment such as BLASTx is still frequently used for homology search because of the conservation among homologous protein sequences. We followed VirusSeeker [10] , which is a BLASTx based model, to align translated reads to virus-only protein database (VIRUSDB NR) provided by NCBI. Then, we kept alignments with E-value cutoff 0.001, which is used in VirusSeeker. The output of BLASTx shows that a read can often align to multiple proteins, making the phylogenetic classification ambiguous (see Fig. 11 ). Also, existing tools such as VirusSeeker often use the best alignment only, which does not always yield the highest accuracy. To optimize the usage of the alignment-based method, we implemented k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm to record the best k alignments rather than only using the best one. The label of the input read is determined by the majority vote in the labels of the top k alignments. According to Fig. 10 , most of the reads have hit numbers between 11 to 15 and 6 to10. Thus, we chose 1, 5, 10, 15 as our k when running kNN. There are also 512 reads that cannot be aligned with any VIRUSDB protein sequence. All these reads will be regarded as wrong prediction. Fig. 11 shows the classification results of kNN. When we use the best hit as the prediction the accuracy is only 64%. The best performance of kNN will be 74% with 2,026 correct predictions when k is 5. But the accuracy sharply decreases if k is larger than 5. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 also revealed that it is hard for users to choose a proper k in real classification tasks. The most common value of the hit number is 11-15 shown in Fig. 11 . The best kNN result, however, has a k equal to 5. Thus, comparing to this alignment-based method, CHEER, with 2,407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly, is more practical and reliable.\\nThe two main purposes of the early stop function are: 1) to handle the cases of a new species from an unseen genus or higher ranks; 2) to serve as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications in child classifiers. As Fig. 6 shows, the higher rank classification tends to be more accurate than lower ranks. Because the genus of Ebolavirus exists in our classification tree, the evaluation of the early stop function focuses on the second purpose. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of how many reads are classified into Ebolavirus genus correctly for different classifiers. By allowing early stop, the number of wrong predictions decreased sharply. In short, although there are fewer reads being labelled at the genus level, the total number of reads with wrong classification is decreased. Thus, this is still a useful feature provided by CHEER.\\nAnother significant advantage of CHEER is the high classification speed. Although training the model uses heavy computing resources, the inference procedure of this algorithm is fast. And with the help of GPU acceleration, the training time also decreases a lot.\\nIn the experiments shown in Section 3.4, it takes around 46 minutes to run BLASTx against the virus protein database. Our method, however, only takes 7 second for the preprocessing step to convert the raw sequence into a vector, and then takes less than 35 second to make the prediction for all 2,737 reads.\\nIn this work, all training data are RNA virus genomes downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq database. The training reads are extracted uniformly from the genome to make sure that classifiers can learn the features from the whole genome. To evaluate the model on new species detection, all species in the test set are excluded from the training data. Error rates are also added to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results reveal that the model is tolerant to the sequencing error. In addition, a SoftMax threshold rejection layer is applied to filter reads from non-RNA viruses. The SoftMax threshold in each classifier will also help early stop classification with low confidence and thus decreases the wrong predication rate. We show a case study on real-world data to identify how this threshold will influence the rejection classifier and early stop function. The results show that CHEER competes favorably with state-of-the-art tools.\\n</td>\n",

Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases.

However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignmentbased and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools. The source code, scripts, and pre-trained parameters for CHEER are available via GitHub: https://github.com/KennthShang/CHEER.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

The first 360 nucleotides at the 5′ 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) .

Although replicons and full-length genomes lacking PKs were 106 replication-competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one 107 PK copy. This is consistent with our earlier report describing the presence of putative 108 packaging signals in the PK region (22). 109 110 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Plasmid construction. 117 The FMDV replicon plasmids, pRep-ptGFP, and the replication-defective polymerase mutant 118 control, 3D-GNN, have already been described (10).\\nTo introduce mutations into the PK region, the pRep-ptGFP replicon plasmid was digested 121 with SpeI and KpnI and the resulting fragment inserted into a sub-cloning vector (pBluescript) 122 to create the pBluescript PK. PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using ΔPK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3′ end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using ΔPK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer. The modified PK sequences were removed from 130 the sub-cloning vectors and inserted into the pRep-ptGFP plasmid using NheI-HF and KpnI-131 HF.\\n132 133 author/funder. All rights reserved.

As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.\\nChanging the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder.

The 5′ UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.\\nMoreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).\\nThe presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

       "1  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 , which by March 2020 has already spread across more than 80 countries 1 . Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia, often resulting in death 2 . Soon after the first epidemiological data together with SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were made available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries.\\nDespite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. In particular, the US-based NextStrain 3 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford, UK, among others. Recently, an editorial published on Science 6 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data.\\nHence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed.\\n.

We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences deposited on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population ( Figure 1 ). As March 10 th 2020, 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available, almost twice as much than just one week earlier (March 3 rd 2020, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries). Yet, the sampling per country was inhomogeneous, with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes (Spearman correlation = 0.03). Moreover, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country.\\nItaly, for example, the second country per confirmed cases, has uploaded so far only two genomes from Lombardy and three from Lazio (Table S1) , i.e. only two of the twenty Italian regions, all with confirmed cases 9 . China and USA contributed with 123 and 63 genomes respectively (56% combined), while 13 countries contribute with only one or two samples (6.3% combined). Notably, three countries with less than 400 confirmed cases have provided a substantial number of genomes (Netherlands 28, Australia 18, Singapore 11; 17% combined) ( Figure 1 ).\\nThe effect of inhomogeneous sampling and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions, like the ones recently rushed through news and (social) media to claim specific dissemination routes of SARS-CoV-2 among countries, can be quite dramatic. An instructive example is the putative introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy from Germany. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree, inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on March 3 rd , 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1 ), showed a well-supported cluster of European and Asian sequences (reported in Figure 2a ), which contained a subclade (subclade A, Figure 2a ) including a sequence isolated in Germany that .

However, in a new tree inferred just one week later, when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on GISAID 8 ( Figure S2 ), the direct link between Germany and Italy has disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from Portugal, Brazil, Wales and Netherland ( Figure 2b ). Most importantly, there is no sufficient evidence of a higher likelihood (Shimodaira-Hasgawa test, Table 1 ) for tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree (see arrows in Figure 2b) compared to the ML tree inferred from the real data. In other words, it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern (and, therefore, phylogeographic reconstruction)\\nis the most likely.\\nLack of resolution and uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected, considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic, even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving RNA virus. Plots of pairwise transitions/transversions vs. genetic distance 10 showed, indeed, low genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes, considerable scattering, and overlap in transitions and transversions among closely related sequences (Figure 3a ). The 331 full genomes available contained 477 out of 29,564 variable sites (1.6%), of which 377 were singleton and only 100 (0.34%) parsimony informative, indicating a substantial lack of phylogenetic information, and raising the possibility of a number of sequencing errors. Further assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11 , which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences (quartet), randomly .

Quartets are considered \"resolved\" when the three likelihoods are significantly different (phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e. data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include <40% of the unresolved quartets 12 , way lower than the 52.9% unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment ( Figure 3b ). It is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any SARS-CoV-2 tree unreliable, and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution. Finally, the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ML tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal (no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time, Figure 3c ). This is, again, expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak. Bayesian analysis 13 , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate. With more genome sequences sampled from different time points and geographic areas made available, literally, every day, Bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option. However, as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable.\\nTaken together, our observations suggest that any conclusion drawn, at present, about existing lineages and direction of viral spread, based on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, is potentially misleading. Nowadays, published scientific data and media are very easily .

We believe that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Any inference based on phylogenetic trees should be considered at the very best preliminary, and hypothesis-generating.\\nHence the need for 1) avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and 2) continuing the concerted scientific effort to increase the number and quality of available data. The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread will unveil an unprecedented amount of information, which is essential to make policy decisions. The whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic, and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing. Some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant, high quality sequence data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases, such as Italy and South Korea, but also from others that seem to be experiencing, at least for now, a lower number of infections.\\nGISAID was accessed on March 3 rd and 10 th , 2020 (final dataset information reported in Table   S1 ). After quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides, the first dataset (March 3 rd 2020) consisted of 169 genomes from 22 countries, while the second (March 10 th , 2020) 331 from 29 countries. Confirmed cases were retrieved for the same day from interactive web-based dashboard developed by Johns Hopkins University 14 .\\nTransition/transversions vs. genetic distance plot were calculated using DAMBE6 10 .

ML tree reconstruction was performed in IQ-TREE based on the best-fit model chosen according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 15, 16 . Topology was tested performing the Shimodaira-Hasegawa 17 on \"Subclade A\" by comparing the inferred tree to three trees where two branches: (Tree 1) Italy (EPI_ISL_412973) switched with Wales (EPI_ISL_413555), (Tree 2) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862 with) Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 3) and Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648) with Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 4) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862) with Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648). All tests performed 10,000 resamplings using the using the RELL approximation method 18 . Position of these genomes within \"Subclade A\" is indicated in Figure 1 with an arrow.\\nExploration of temporal structure, i.e. presence of molecular clock in the data, was assessed by regression of divergence -root-to-tip genetic distance-against sampling time using TempEst 19 . In this case, absence of a linear trend indicates that the data does not contain temporal signal and that the data is not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models.\\nAncestral state reconstruction of full datasets reported in Figures S1 and S2 were based on the ML tree obtained with IQ-TREE and performed using TreeTime 20 . We choose to show the \"European subclade\" and \"Subclade A\" as cladograms in Figure 1 as there are no phylogenetic and temporal signals in the datasets: scaling phylogenies in time or nucleotide substitution in this case is misleading. .

       "2  The 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread across China and 24 other countries 1-3 as of February 8, 2020 . The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.\\nHealthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.\\nThis study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.\\nRecent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.\\nThe Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .\\nThe ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.\\nThe reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. \\n

       "3  The outbreak of infectious diseases has always been one of the most important health problems in the world. With the rapid spread of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , much attention has been paid to subjects like rate of an epidemic, transition ways, prevention methods, and remaining time of the virus in the environment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, the behavior of the virus in relation to environmental factors is critical. The coronavirus is one of the epidemic diseases that many countries have experienced in the new type of it, COVID-19, and can become a serious challenge and affect the previous efforts on sustainable development [6] [7] [8] [9] .\\nIt has been found that there are some delays between the detection of confirmed cases and the actual infection date due to the laboratory test, the time of the announcement of confirmed cases in media, and the time for the patients showing initial symptoms for a total usually of 3 to 5 days [10] [11] [12] . The analysis of Kampf et al. (2020) demonstrated that COVID-19 could remain up to 9 days on different materials based on temperature and humidity [13] . Cascella et al. (2020) conducted research on the new coronavirus structure. Their analysis shows that the virus belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ ssRNA), which has a length of about 30 kb and an envelope with spear structures and they tested the sensitivity of the virus to UV and temperature [14] . investigated the correlations between environmental factors and the number of positive cases of COVID-19 by the use of artificial intelligence techniques. The results of this study put evidence on the role of urban and weather conditions on the epidemic rate [15] . Chen et al. (2020) developed a time-dependent mathematical model for the prediction of the total number of positive cases [16] . Lytle and Sagripanti (2005) studied the impact of UV rays, and their results determined that it can affect the structure of coronaviruses because UV rays could damage the nucleic acids of viral RNA that is vital for the survival of the virus [17] . developed an assessment method for investigating the impact of climate and urban factors in confirmed cases of COVID-19 [18] . Bukhari et al., (2020) , studied the epidemic of COVID-19 on tropical zones and their results show that the highest number of infection happened in temperature among 3 to 17 ºC [19] .\\nThe analysis of Grant and Giovannucci (2009) shows that by increasing the UV, the level of vitamin D in the body increases and makes the infection rates decrease. Therefore, in areas on lower latitudes and closer to the equator line, the epidemic on COVID-19 might be different [20] . In the study of Chan et al. (2011) , the effect of temperature and humidity on SARS coronavirus was analyzed, and they found that increasing temperature decreases the epidemic rate by faster disabling virus structure on contaminated surfaces [21] . Pirouz and Violini (2020) , analyzed the outbreak patterns of COVID-19 by analysis of 117 countries. They suggested two mechanisms of triggering the development of the infection, namely the normal spread of an infection from one parent case and the consequence of a unique phenomenon of accumulation of contagious people [22] . Analysis of the previous studies demonstrates the necessity of further research about the effect of environmental factors on the COVID-19. Since some of the previous researches have shown the effect of weather conditions, especially temperature, on coronavirus viruses, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the better correlation of daily mean air temperature on the epidemic rate of the COVID-19.\\nIn this study, we analysed the number of positive contagions of coronavirus COVID-19, from February 29 th to March 19 th . The selection of February 29 th is due to existence on this date of at least one positive case of COVID-19 in all case studies studied. The analysis of the weather data started from February15 th and ended on March 18 th because the impact of the weather parameter would occur in the upcoming days. Thus, the considered average daily temperature is with an interval of 1 to 14 days before the definitive cases of COVID-19.\\n In order to minimize the impact of other parameters on the results, such as the policy of each government, cultural differences between countries, health care systems, or the protocols in getting coronavirus test, comparative analysis have been done for different regions of the same country, without comparing with each other the results of different countries;  The analysis period for average daily temperature ranges from February15 th , 2020 to March18 th , 2020 (33 days);  The analysis period for confirmed cases of coronavirus COVID-19 is from February 29 th to March19 th ;  For what concerns the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, the total number of confirmed cases in a region was divided into the population of that region in order to take into account the different size of the population in each region.\\nTo carry out the analysis, the datasets of five countries and in each country, of three regions/provinces have been considered. The selected case studies are presented in Table 1 . and the location of the three regions shown in Figures 1. \\nMathematical models have been successfully used for the analysis of many hazards [32, 33] . In complex subjects, different Mathematical models can be used to solve the problem [34] [35] [36] . Statistical tests are an appropriate method for the investigation of possible correlations between different datasets [37] . Many statistical tests can be used for the analysis of significant differences between the datasets, among which F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test [38] .\\nIn order to investigate the hypothesis about a correlation between significant differences (Sig.) of average daily temperatures and average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases in two regions, the following assumptions, and statistical tests have been done:\\n The variances of the two groups are equal: H0  The variances of the two groups are not equal: H1\\n.

Conversely, if the significance level (sig.) is larger than 0.05, the hypothesis H1 is rejected, and the hypothesis H0 is accepted, i.e., the variances of the datasets in the two selected regions are equal.\\nThrough F-test, one determines the presence or absence of differences in the variances of the two regions. Through another statistical test, the Independent-Samples T-Test, one can determine whether the difference is significant, has been used. When using Independent-Samples T-Test, a significance level (sig.) lower (higher) than 0.05, means that the difference is (is not) significant.\\nIn our analysis, we used SPSS software. The critical factors in the SPSS Model set up are as follow:\\n The datasets in different regions of the same countries were analyzed with respect to the average daily air temperature during the 33-day period from 15-Feb to 18-Mar and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the 19 days from 29-Feb to 19-Mar.  In all statistical tests, the confidence level of 95% is considered.  First, the F-test was used to test whether there is a significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies, and then, depending on the F-test result, by the T-Test the existence of a significant difference between the data of the two cases was investigated.\\nThe average daily temperature [39, 40] , and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases [41] , are shown in Figures 2 to 6.\\na. Average daily temperature b. Cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases Correlations between the average temperatures and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases were found especially for towns with significant differences, with respect to the other two towns of the same country, in the average daily temperature. This was the case for Bandar Abas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. The average daily temperature and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases are listed in Table 2 . As a general feature of Table 2 , we notice that  In 11 out of the possible fifteen comparisons, the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is higher when the average daily temperature is lower, and in the four remaining cases the differences in either variable are small.\\nA more specific analysis per country shows that  In Iran, the average daily temperature in Bandar Abbas was the highest (21.54 ºC), and the average cumulative rate of daily of confirmed cases was the lowest (0.000027). .

However, the comparison of Santa Cruz with higher average daily temperatures shows a slower spread of COVID-19.  In the United States, the average daily air temperature in both New York and Seattle are lower than Los Angeles, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases shows the spread of the virus in both is faster than in Los Angeles.\\nThese qualitative results reflect in the statistical analysis of the data by F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test presented in Table 3 .

From the F-test, the F value is equal to 20.4. The criterion for variance equality in the F-test is that the F value must smaller than the critical F value. The statistical analysis has been done on a statistical confidence level of 95%, and therefore the error level is 0.05, and considering the degrees of freedom, the critical F value of the test that can be found through F distribution tables [42] , in this case, is equal to F = 1.57. Since the F value we found is 20.4, larger than the critical F value, the assumption of the equality of variances is rejected. It means that the average temperature variance of the Ramsar and Tehran are not equal.\\nAccording to the t-test, the t value for these two cities is equal to -1.929. Based on an error level of 0.05 and by considering the degrees of freedom, the critical values of the test indicated in the T distribution tables [43] , is in this case equal to t = ± 1.645. Since the t value is out of the critical boundary (-1.645 ≤ acceptable t ≤ +1.645), the assumption of equality in the averages is rejected, and the existence of difference in averages is confirmed. Thus from two tests, it is evident that there is a significant difference between the average temperature of the two cities of Ramsar and Tehran.\\nAn analogous result holds for the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.\\nThe main results of Table 4 , with a confidence level of 95% are as follow:\\n In Iran, the city of Bandar Abbas is significantly different from Ramsar and Tehran in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.  In Italy, the city of Milan is significantly different from Rome and Naples in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases. Instead, the two cities of Rome and Napoli are not significantly different in terms of these variables.  In Germany, there are no significant differences in average daily temperature in all three cities, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different.  In Spain, Barcelona and Valencia are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different. However, in Barcelona and Santa Cruz, the average daily temperature is significantly different, as well as the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, and the same trend exists between Valencia and Santa Cruz.  In the United States, the two cities of New York and Seattle are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and of the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, the number of patients is not significantly different. Instead, the city of Los Angeles is significantly different in terms of average daily temperature with two cities of New York and Seattle, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases are different significantly.\\nThe results of our analysis of daily air temperature for three case studies from five countries showed the existence of correlations between the average temperatures and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when the differences in average daily temperature are larger. For example, in Iran and Italy, the regions with lower average daily temperature had a higher epidemic level of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , and the same trend exists in all other case studies.\\nThe statistical analysis showed that in all the case studies we considered, referring to five different countries, if there is a significant difference in daily mean temperature, there is also a significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, supporting the proposed research hypothesis about the correlation between air temperature and the epidemic rates of COVID-19. Due to the correlations among temperature and hours of sunshine for future research, it is recommended to study the effects of the sun's UV rays as well as the average hours of sunshine on the epidemic rates of COVID-19.\\nThis study analyzed the possible correlation of daily average air temperature with the epidemic rate of the coronavirus (COVID-19) using significant differences analysis between the datasets. The research hypothesis is that in regions with a significant difference in the average daily temperature, the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases would also is different significantly. Conversely, to the absence of a significant difference in daily temperature, would correspond no significant difference in the rate of confirmed cases. The hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately. This comparison using statistical analysis through F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test of the daily temperatures and daily rate of confirmed cases shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.\\n.

       "4  Metagenomic sequencing, which allows us to directly obtain total genomic DNAs from host-associated and environmental samples, has led to important findings in many areas, such as digestive health [1] . While bacteria are the main focus of most metagenomic sequencing projects, there are fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data with sequencing viruses as the main purpose [2] . There are different types of viruses. We are mainly concerned with RNA viruses because many RNA viruses are notorious human pathogens, such as Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, SARS-CoV, and recently identified 2019-nCoV causing Wuhan pneumonia. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. This high genetic diversity within and across different hosts poses a great challenge for designing long-term protection strategies against these infectious diseases. For example, as the circulating strains can change every year, flu vaccine has to be administered every year.\\nAdvances in viral metagenomics have contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. According to a survey by Woolhouse et. al, the number of newly identified RNA viruses is changing from 1,899 in 2005 to 5,561 in 2018, which is 3 times of increase [3] . Largescale RNA virus sequencing projects using nextgeneration sequencing technologies have been conducted for different species. For example, Shi et al. have discovered a large number of new RNA viruses by sequencing samples from invertebrate and vertebrate animals [4, 5] . Claire et al. have discovered 25 new RNA viruses by sequencing samples associated with different drosophilid [6] . Bolduc et al. sequenced RNA viruses from Archaeal and bacterial samples [7] . Given fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data and expected discovery of new viruses, a key step is to conduct composition analysis for these data and assign taxonomic groups for possibly new species.\\nComposition analysis can be conducted at the read level or contig level. There is no doubt that contigs can provide more information than short reads in taxonomic classification. However, metagenomic assembly is still one of the most challenging computational problems in bioinformatics. Unlike single genome assembly, metagenomic assembly is more likely to produce chimeric contigs that can contain regions from different species. Thus, metagenomic assembly is often preceded by read binning that groups reads with the same or similar taxonomic labels [8] in order to achieve better performance.\\nIn this work, we design a read level taxonomic classification tool (named as \"CHEER\") for labeling new species in viral metagenomic data. To detect known species with available reference genomes, alignment-based methods can provide sufficient information for both classification and abundance estimation. This function has been incorporated in existing pipelines [9, 10, 11] and is thus not the focus of our tool. Instead, our tool is designed to handle the challenging cases of assigning taxonomic labels for reads of new species, which have not been observed before. This problem was clearly formulated in metagenomic phylogenetic classification tools such as Phymm and PhymmBL [8] . We first define the classification problem following the formulation in Phymm: the classification problem is the assignment of a phylogenetic group label to each read in input data sets. As we are only interested in the hard case of classifying reads of new species, which have not been sequenced and thus no label exists for these species, the expected labels for these reads are the higher-rank taxonomic groups such as genus, family, or order. All our data and experiments are designed so that the test species are masked in the reference database and the trained models.\\nPrevious experiments have shown that nucleotide-level homology search is not sensitive enough for assigning higher rank taxonomic groups to reads from new species [9, 10] . Protein-based homology search is thus preferred for phylogenetic classification [11, 12] . In particular, a recent tool, VirusSeeker [13] utilized BLASTx to classify reads into bacteria, phages, and other viruses. It is not clear whether the protein homology search is able to generate accurate classification at lower ranks. We will evaluate this in our experiments.\\nThere are also alignment-free methods for phylogenetic classification. Many of those tools implemented different machine learning models and were mainly designed for bacteria. For example, RDP [14] adopted a Naïve Bayes based classifier that can automatically learn features from the reads and assigned taxonomic labels to sequences from bacterial and archaeal 16S genes and fungal 28S genes. The NBC classifier [15, 16] encoded metagenomic reads using k-mers and implemented a bag-of-word model to achieve the readlevel taxonomic classification. Phymm [8] utilized interpolated Markov models (IMMs) for metagenomic read classification. These learning-based models enable users to label reads originating from new species.\\nThe previous works have shown that sequence composition is still an important and informative feature for phylogenetic classification. Recent applications of deep learning models have achieved better performance than conventional machine learning methods in different sequence classification problems [17] . In particular, the convolution filters in Convolutional Neural Network models (CNN) can represent degenerated sequence motifs and thus help CNN models to learn abstract composition-based features. For example, frequently activated convolution filters learned by DeepFam often represented the conserved motifs in different protein domain families [18] . The successful applications of deep learning in sequence classification motivated us to design a novel deep learning-based classification model for assigning taxonomic groups for new species in viral metagenomic data.\\nOur main contributions are summarized below. First, our deep learning model can assign higher rank phylogenetic group labels (such as genus) for reads from new species. To achieve this goal, our model organizes multiple CNN-based classifiers in a tree for hierarchical taxonomic group assignment. Second, to enable our model to capture as much information as possible from short reads, we implemented and compared two encoding methods: one hot vs. embedding. Third, as viral metagenomic data usually contains contaminations from either the host genomes or other microbes, we formulated the pre-processing step as an open set problem in targeted image classification and rejected non-viral reads by choosing appropriate negative training sets. We tested our model on both simulated metagenomic data and also real sequencing data. The results show that our model competes favorably with other popular methods.\\nIn this section, we will introduce our method for viral metagenomic taxonomic classification. First, we will show the architecture of CHEER, which is a hierarchical classification model from order to genus. Second, classifiers at each level will be described. Third, we will introduce DNA sequence encoding using skipgram based word embedding and compare it with onehot encoding. Forth, we will describe the rejection layer, following the idea of the open set problem, which is adopted to filter reads not belonging to RNA viruses. Finally, we will detail our dataset used in training and validation.\\nThe architecture of our model is sketched in Fig. 1. The key component is a tree model that consists of multiple classifiers from order to genus. In order to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species, or even new genus, our classification is conducted using a top-down approach from the root to the leaf node. The top layer is a trained CNN that can reject reads not belonging to RNA viruses, which is an important preprocessing step for viral metagenomic data because of the contamination from the host genome or other microbes. Then, the filtered reads (i.e. mostly RNA viral reads) will be fed into the hierarchical classification model, which is referred to as the tree model hereafter. Specifically, the order-level classifier is responsible for classifying the reads into their originating orders. Then each order has a separately trained classifier for assigning input reads to families within that order (O1 to O3 in Fig. 1 ). For all the reads assigned into one family, the family classifier (F1-F7) will assign the reads to different genus within that family. As an example, a path for classifying a read from a species in genus 7 is highlighted in Fig. 1 . CHEER also implemented early stop functions at each level for stopping the classification path at higher ranks. This function can accommodate taxonomic classification for species from new genus or even higher ranks, which is possible for RNA viruses. It is convenient to add fine-grained classifiers within each genus so that we can assign species-level labels. However, as our focus is to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species that do not have a species labels in the training data, we did not include the species-level assignment in this work.\\nAlternative designs of hierarchical classification work, like [19, 20] , either build a classifier for each taxonomic rank or build a binary classifier for each class. We implemented a structure that built just one classifier for each taxonomic rank and compared different structures' performance. According to the result shown in [Supplementary file 1], the structure shown in Fig.1 is better than one classifier per rank. Although one classifier per rank requires fewer classifiers, it needs to train many more parameters because the number of labels for each classifier increases by times. As a result, we observe overfitting more frequently.\\nEach classifier in the tree model is implemented using CNN, which has achieved superior performance in various sequence classification problems [18] . The convolution filters used in CNN resemble positionspecific weight matrix of motifs in genomic sequences. Frequently activated convolution filters can represent well-conserved motifs among sequences in the same class. Thus, a large number of convolution filters will be used in our CNN in order to learn well-conserved sequence features in different classes. Deep CNNs in fields such as computer vision often have multiple convolution layers in order to obtain more abstract features from training images. Here, we use a wide convolution design rather than a deep one, following the idea in [18] . Fig. 2 shows the classifier with the default hyper-parameters. First, reads will be encoded in matrices as input to the convolution layer using two methods. We will describe and compare these two encoding methods later in the Section 2.3. Then, multiple convolution filters of different sizes are utilized to learn the conserved sequence features. According to our empirical study, we choose 3, 7, 11, 15 as the filter sizes, with 256 filters for each size respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Max pooling is then applied to each convolution filter's output so that only the highest convolution value is kept. After the max-pooling layer, we have a 256-dimentional vector as the output of each convolution layer. We concatenate these four vectors into one 1024-dimentional vector and feed it to one fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting. The CrossEntropyLoss function supplied by Pytorch is adopted as an error estimation function. Due to the unbalanced size of each training class, we use the reciprocal of the proportion of each class as their error weight to help the model fairly learn from each class. And we utilize Adam optimizer with a 0.001 learning rate to update the parameters. The model is trained on HPCC with the 2080Ti GPU unit. \\nIn previous deep learning-based sequence classification models [21, 22] , one hot encoding was commonly adopted to convert a sequence into a matrix, which will then be used as input to convolution layers. There also exist some methods using k-mer composition [23] and frequency [15, 16] to encode the DNA sequence, similar to the bag-of-words model in the field of natural language processing. However, these k-mers representation cannot give complete sequential information about the original reads.\\nTo incorporate both the k-mer composition and also their ordering information, we build a Skip-Gram [24] based embedding layer that can learn which k-mers tend to occur close to each other. Embedding is widely used in natural language processing to learn the semantic and syntactic relationships from sentences. A neural network with one hidden layer is trained to map a word to an n-dimensional vector so that the words that usually occur together will be closer in the n-dimension space. For our DNA read classification task, k-mers are the words and the embedding layer will map proximate kmers into vectors of high similarity. The main hyper-parameter when training the skip-gram model is the size of the training context m, which defines the maximum context location at which the furthest k-mer is taken for training. Specifically, for a kmer at position i as the input to the skip-gram model, the output k-mers are its neighbors located at i+jk, where −m ≤ ≤ m. Larger m results in more training samples with a cost of training time. In our model, the default value of m is 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , we will sample 3 k-mers as our dataset at a time with the middle one as the input and the surrounding two as the output.\\nAs proven in [24] , Skip-Gram is able to automatically learn the relationship between proximate words and thus is expected to help learn the order between k-mers in genomic data. We implemented a hidden layer with 100 hidden units shown in Fig. 3 . After training the model, the co-occurrence features are embedded in the output of the hidden layer. Thus, a k-mer in a read will be represented as a 100-dimension vector, where each element in the vector is the output of the hidden unit in the hidden layer.\\nWhen we use this pre-trained embedding layer to encode the reads, we first split each read into sequential k-mers. Second, each k-mer is fed to the embedding layer and the output is a 100-dimension vector. Third, all these vectors are combined into a large matrix according to the original position of each k-mers. Finally, this matrix will be fed to the convolutional layer.\\nBased on our large-scale experiments, we found that classifiers are easy to overfit with increase of k. Thus, we choose 100-dimensional feature vectors with k being 3 as our default embedding layer parameter set based on our empirical analysis.\\nDue to the small genome size and limitations in library construction, it is not rare that many viral metagenomic datasets are still contaminated with the genomes of the host and other microbes. Viral read screening is thus a key pre-processing step before the downstream composition analysis. Specifically, our tree model should only be applied to viral reads. However, the close set nature of the classifier forces it to assign a known label to each input without being able to distinguish viral reads from others. In this work, we will reject non-viral reads by formulating it as an open set problem in targeted image classification [25] .\\nIn a majority of neural network models [26, 27] , the logit of the last layer will be fed into the SoftMax function, which takes a vector of n real numbers as input and output a normalized probability vector for all labels/classes. However, for an irrelevant input from an unknown clade, all classes in the model tend to have low probabilities and thus applying a threshold on uncertainty can be used to reject unknown classes [25] . Along with this idea, serval approaches [28, 29] have been proposed to solve the open set problem.\\nIn this work, we incorporate the pre-processing step in our hierarchical classification model by integrating a trained CNN and a SoftMax threshold. Contaminations such as bacteria will be rejected using empirically chosen SoftMax threshold τ. Our experiments show that SoftMax outputs a nearly uniform probability distribution of all labels if the input is not relevant. Thus, the SoftMax threshold τ is used to reject reads not belonging to either DNA or RNA viruses. However, using this thresholding method is not able to distinguish DNA viral reads from RNA viral reads due to their similar sequence composition. To accommodate this challenge, we designed a rejection classifier in the top layer using DNA viral reads as the negative class in the training (see Fig. 1 ).\\nAs the focus of our work is to assign labels for new species, the hierarchical classification ends at genuslevel assignment, which is conducted by the bottom layer in Fig. 1 . Given the fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data, there are cases where a new species does not belong to any existing genus and thus the label assignment should stop at the higher ranks. Thus, we allow our model to stop at a higher rank in the tree during the top-down classification. Towards this goal, we still apply SoftMax threshold in our early stop function, which stops reads from further classification by the child classifiers. This early stop function also serves as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications if the confidence is low. For example, when a read arrives, the model may be able to identify its order and family labels with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. In this case, the model should only assign order and family label to this read rather than classifying it into a potentially wrong genus. To achieve this goal, SoftMax threshold is applied for every classifier in the tree. Only reads with a score higher than the threshold will be assigned to the child class.\\nAn example of early stop is highlighted by the yellow path in Fig. 1 . The model can classify the read into order 2 (O2) and then family 4 (F4) with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to.\\nAll the viruses used in the experiments were obtained from the RefSeq in the NCBI virus database. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009001 doi: bioRxiv preprint viruses' taxonomic classification was downloaded from Virus Taxonomy 2018b Release [30] published by the International Committee on Taxonomic of Virus (ICVT). Because training deep learning classifiers required enough samples, we removed the orders with only one family, families with only one genus, and genera with less than 3 species from our dataset. Finally, there are 6 orders, 23 families, and 55 genera remained. The RefSeq genomes are available at the following URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/fi nd-data/virus. The information of the taxa can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. As CHEER conducts read-level taxonomic classification, the training is also conducted using reads. In order to train our model on each complete virus genome, we generated simulated reads by uniformly extracting substrings of 250 bp with 200bp overlaps. All these reads formed the training set so that the model can learn the features from the whole genome. The validation set, however, is generated by read simulation tool WgSim [31] with specified error rate so that we can have a better estimation of the model's performance on real sequencing data. Some existing deep learning tools for taxonomic classification, like [21, 23] , generate reads first, then randomly choose some of them as training set and others as testing set. This strategy cannot guarantee that the training and testing data sets have no overlaps from the same species. In order to test whether our model can learn the label of new species, we use test species masking in the training set. Specifically, we split our RNA virus database into two independent sets. For any test species, their reads are not used in the training data. Thus, the model will only use the knowledge of known species for the new species classification.\\nIn this section, we will first give details of the hyperparameters of CHEER. Then we present the results of applying CHEER to both simulated and mock sequencing data. For the simulated data by WgSim, we evaluated how sequencing error rate affects the performance of CHEER and compared the taxonomic classification results with state-of-the-art. For the mock data, we tested CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and its ability in distinguishing viral reads from others.\\nIn our experiments, the minimum number of species within a genus is 3. We thus constructed three test sets, each containing reads from one species that is randomly chosen from each genus. The three test sets contain three different species, respectively. In total, 165 species from 55 genera are chosen to be \"new\" species for testing and the information of these species can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nWe used WgSim to simulate reads from testing species. In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing error on CHEER, we simulated reads with an error rate of 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively. For each classifier (CNN), we computed the classification accuracy, which is defined in equation (1). To ensure that the computation of the accuracy is not affected by the number of reads from different species, we constructed a balanced test read set by simulating the same number of reads for each test species (1,000 reads for each). (1) For each component classifier in the tree model, we record the average accuracy for multiple test species. For each taxa level, we calculate the average accuracy of all the classifiers in the same level.\\nWe present the results of CHEER at each level in this section. Because CHEER is designed for new species, we benchmark it against alignment-free models. Based on the results shown by Wood et al. [7] , Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) outperformed other alignment-free models. Thus, we compared the performance of CHEER and NBC. NBC in [14] was designed for bacteria taxonomic classification and thus, we retrained NBC on our RNA virus dataset. We implemented the NBC model following [14] with the same parameters. Since each family has a separately trained classifier, which conducts genus classification within that family, there are totally 14 classifiers at this level. Fig. 5 shows the accuracy for labeling families. There are totally 6 classifiers that assign reads to families within each of the 6 orders. Fig. 6 shows the mean accuracy at each rank. The family and genus level accuracy are the average accuracy of all classifiers in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . There is only one classifier for order level classification.\\nAs shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 , CHEER has better performance than NBC across different ranks. We also compared the performance of using one-hot encoding and embedding layer in CHEER. The performance comparison at each rank shows that for most of the classifiers, the embedding layer improves the learning ability. Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 also revealed the robustness of CHEER. Although the classification accuracy decreases as the error rate increases, the decrease is smaller than 2%. The accuracy is almost identical for many classifiers. Thus, CHEER is not very sensitive to sequencing errors. We also conducted experiments for reads with higher error rates (0.02 and 0.05). The results can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nThe next experiment is to evaluate our model on a real sequencing dataset and test CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and non-viral read rejection. We built a mock dataset by mixing Ebolavirus reads with gut bacterial reads from a gut amplicon sequencing dataset, which is chosen to ensure that we only use reads from bacteria. The taxonomic classification of Zaire Ebolavirus in the tree model is highlighted in Fig. 7 . We chose one of the Ebola species named Zaire Ebolavirus as our testing species because it is the most dangerous of the five Ebolavirus species and was responsible for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We downloaded the dataset from NCBI with accession number SRR1930021. These reads were sequenced by Illumina using whole-genome amplification strategy. Since Zaire Ebolavirus usually causes fatal hemorrhagic fever and abdominal pain, it is possible that this Ebola virus occurs with other gut bacteria. Thus, we created a mock viral metagenomic data by mixing these Ebola reads with a gut bacteria amplicon sequencing data in order to test whether CHEER can reject the bacterial reads at the top rejection layer. The gut bacteria dataset is downloaded from NCBI with accession number: SRR10714026. There are totally 2,737 Ebola virus reads and 51,280 gut bacterial reads in the mock data. After the rejection layer, the Ebola reads will be used to evaluate our tree model.\\nTo treat Zaire Ebolavirus as a \"new\" species, we removed its genome from our training set and re-trained the whole pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7 , after removing this species, we still have four Ebola species in our training set. However, our read mapping experiment using Bowtie2 [32] showed that none of the reads from Zaire Ebolavirus can be mapped to other Ebola species with the default parameters, indicating that using usual alignment-based methods will have difficulty to conduct genus-level assignment.\\nIn our work, CHEER will first use rejection layer to remove the reads not belonging to the RNA virus. Second, the \"Order classifier\" will be applied to evaluate how many reads can be classified into Mononegavirales order. Third, \"Mononegavirales classifier\" takes all these Mononegavirales reads as input to predict how many reads will be assigned to the Filoviridae family. Finally, \"Filoviridae classifier\" is adopted to check how many reads belong to the Ebola genus. Fig. 8 show the ROC curve of the rejection layer. True positive rate reveals how many Ebolavirus reads pass the rejection layer. The false positive rate reveals how many gut bacterial reads pass the rejection layer. We generated thresholds from 0 to 1 with step size 0.01 and used each threshold for the rejection layer. Then for each threshold, we recorded the true positive rate and false positive rate for plotting the ROC curve. As shown in Fig. 8 , with the increase of the threshold, more bacterial reads are filtered by the rejection layer, at the expense of missing more real Ebola reads. The default threshold for the rejection layer is 0.6 in CHEER. User can adjust the threshold according to their needs.\\nAfter evaluating the rejection layer, we continued to test the hierarchical classification performance at each rank. We first compared our tree model with NBC. Then we also benchmarked CHEER with the method using protein-level alignment in Section 3.3.3. The performance of the complete hierarchical classification pipeline of NBC and CHEER is shown in Fig. 9 . From order to genus, each bar shows the accuracy of correctly classified reads by the parent classifier. For example, NBC correctly classified 1580 at the order level. Then, 1564 out of the 1580 reads are correctly labeled at the family level. While Fig. 4 , 5, and 6 have shown the performance of CHEER and NBC at each taxonomic rank using the same set of reads as input for each level of classifiers, this experiment focused on comparing the hierarchical classification pipeline using only correctly predicted reads by the parent classifier. The results demonstrated that CHEER can classify Ebola reads with better performance. NBC can only classify 1,564 (57.1%) reads into Ebolavirus. CHEER, however, had totally 2407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly.\\nAlthough nucleotide-level alignment models are not ideal choices for predicting new species, as mentioned in [8] , protein-level alignment such as BLASTx is still frequently used for homology search because of the conservation among homologous protein sequences. We followed VirusSeeker [10] , which is a BLASTx based model, to align translated reads to virus-only protein database (VIRUSDB NR) provided by NCBI. Then, we kept alignments with E-value cutoff 0.001, which is used in VirusSeeker. The output of BLASTx shows that a read can often align to multiple proteins, making the phylogenetic classification ambiguous (see Fig. 11 ). Also, existing tools such as VirusSeeker often use the best alignment only, which does not always yield the highest accuracy. To optimize the usage of the alignment-based method, we implemented k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm to record the best k alignments rather than only using the best one. The label of the input read is determined by the majority vote in the labels of the top k alignments. According to Fig. 10 , most of the reads have hit numbers between 11 to 15 and 6 to10. Thus, we chose 1, 5, 10, 15 as our k when running kNN. There are also 512 reads that cannot be aligned with any VIRUSDB protein sequence. All these reads will be regarded as wrong prediction. Fig. 11 shows the classification results of kNN. When we use the best hit as the prediction the accuracy is only 64%. The best performance of kNN will be 74% with 2,026 correct predictions when k is 5. But the accuracy sharply decreases if k is larger than 5. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 also revealed that it is hard for users to choose a proper k in real classification tasks. The most common value of the hit number is 11-15 shown in Fig. 11 . The best kNN result, however, has a k equal to 5. Thus, comparing to this alignment-based method, CHEER, with 2,407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly, is more practical and reliable.\\nThe two main purposes of the early stop function are: 1) to handle the cases of a new species from an unseen genus or higher ranks; 2) to serve as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications in child classifiers. As Fig. 6 shows, the higher rank classification tends to be more accurate than lower ranks. Because the genus of Ebolavirus exists in our classification tree, the evaluation of the early stop function focuses on the second purpose. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of how many reads are classified into Ebolavirus genus correctly for different classifiers. By allowing early stop, the number of wrong predictions decreased sharply. In short, although there are fewer reads being labelled at the genus level, the total number of reads with wrong classification is decreased. Thus, this is still a useful feature provided by CHEER.\\nAnother significant advantage of CHEER is the high classification speed. Although training the model uses heavy computing resources, the inference procedure of this algorithm is fast. And with the help of GPU acceleration, the training time also decreases a lot.\\nIn the experiments shown in Section 3.4, it takes around 46 minutes to run BLASTx against the virus protein database. Our method, however, only takes 7 second for the preprocessing step to convert the raw sequence into a vector, and then takes less than 35 second to make the prediction for all 2,737 reads.\\nIn this work, all training data are RNA virus genomes downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq database. The training reads are extracted uniformly from the genome to make sure that classifiers can learn the features from the whole genome. To evaluate the model on new species detection, all species in the test set are excluded from the training data. Error rates are also added to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results reveal that the model is tolerant to the sequencing error. In addition, a SoftMax threshold rejection layer is applied to filter reads from non-RNA viruses. The SoftMax threshold in each classifier will also help early stop classification with low confidence and thus decreases the wrong predication rate. We show a case study on real-world data to identify how this threshold will influence the rejection classifier and early stop function. The results show that CHEER competes favorably with state-of-the-art tools.\\n   \n",
