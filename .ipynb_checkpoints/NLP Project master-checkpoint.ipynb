The first one is: a <i>search engine</i> which allows the user to enter a query and fetches for them the most relevant papers related to that query (max 5). The other topic is <i>literature clustering</i> where PCA algorithm was used to reduce the dimension of the data, followed by K-means which was used to cluster the papers. This notebook intends to tackle Kaggle's task 1.</p>"

       "abstract     [{'text': 'Zoonoses represent a public health risk recently pointed out by the spreading of previously unknown human infectious diseases emerging from animal reservoirs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza caused by H5N1-virus. These outbreaks have shown that animal breeding activities can pose a significant public health risk. Until now, the risk of zoonoses has probably been underestimated, particularly in occupational settings. The emergence or re-emergence of bacterial (Mycobacterium bovis and Brucella spp) or viral (hepatitis E virus) infections shows that zoonoses should be considered as emerging risks in agricultural and animal breeding and should be addressed by specific preventive interventions. Close cooperation and interaction between veterinarians, occupational health physicians and public health operators is necessary, for a worldwide strategy to ex pand interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment. This is what the One Health Approach was intended to be.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]

       "full_text    www.e-shaw.org at predicting the risk of an epidemic or at least at detecting early signs of its onset.\\nPrevention is based on knowledge, but very often the processes by which zoonoses emerge and re-emerge are complex and poorly understood [3] , mainly because a single event, or a chain of events, that promote the emergence of a disease and/ or its evolution into an endemic disease, often vary on a case by case basis, and are affected by several factors such as genetic evolution, environmental conditions, climate changes affecting the vector's distribution, demographic changes, movement of animals, etc. [4] . Predicting which zoonotic diseases may emerge, or become endemic, is extremely difficult due to the multifactorial and constantly evolving nature of the risk factors involved (Table 1) , with the exception of vector-borne infections, whose onset, due to their correlation with environmental factors, can be, in some aspects, anticipated [5] .\\nThe size of the problem is significant: according to Cunningham [6] , about 61% of the several diseases attributable to human pathogens are zoonotic. Since an emerging zoonoses is a disease that is newly recognized or newly evolved, or that has occurred previously but shows an increase in incidence or in geographical expansion, host or vector range, it is evident www.e-shaw.org that these diseases might not be easily recognized at their first manifestation, and might be public health risks, as confirmed by epidemiological data suggesting that about 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and originate mainly from wildlife [7] . Based on the above considerations, it can be easily argued that the list of more than 200 zoonoses known, in some cases for many centuries, might be increased by the number of the new emerging and re-emerging ones. Each emergence or reemergence may pose a public health risk that deserves particular attention from the public systems of research and prevention. Several human occupations require contact with animals and some selected workers' subgroups are particularly exposed to the zoonotic risk. Such risk should be considered and addressed in risk assessment and management activities. Among occupational groups at risk are workers in contact with living animals such as veterinarians, animal farmers, zoo workers, fishermen, fish farmers, hunters, animal trainers, animal sanctuary workers, animal cruelty inspectors; workers in contact with animal carcasses and products (slaughtermen, butchers, meat inspectors, fishmongers, food industry and catering workers); workers who have laboratory exposure to infectious specimens (medical laboratory workers, animal researchers…); and finally workers who have environmental exposure such as agricultural workers, forestry workers, sewage workers or outdoor activity instructors, guides, and park keepers.\\nIn this paper we have selected specific examples of animal infectious diseases that are transmissible to humans and the related causal factors, not with the aim of doing an exhaustive review, but with the aim of identifying cases exemplifying the current situation.\\nIn some cases, at the basis of the disease's emergence, there are increases in the density of animal or wildlife populations associated with intensive breeding methods for domestic animals, and proximity with human and animal populations caused by growth of the human settlements [8] . Examples diseases are Mycobacterium bovis (M. Bovis), Brucella spp. or Francisella tularensis' infection in cattle breeders.\\nIn developing countries, as reported by Kock et al. [9] in Africa, the close contact between human and livestock populations have led to major health problems, and in particular to the creation of a cycle of degradation and disease affecting especially traditional pastoral systems with a close physical association between people, livestock, and wild animals. An example is the recent outbreaks of M. bovis in wildlife in Kruger National Park, whose onset originated from an infected cattle herd [10] .\\nAs for new viral pathogens with animal origins, hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for many sporadic waterborne cases and epidemics around the world, as confirmed by the case of the Cruise Ship \"Aurora\", which took place in in 2008 [11] . HEV infection may be asymptomatic in industrialized countries, where it can be considered quite rare, with a tendency toward an increase, possibly mediated by migration flows from endemic countries [12] . Consumption of raw meat of infected animals, in particular pigs, as well as occupations involving contact with pigs or biologic pig materials have been identified as possible routes of transmission. Different studies have shown that in swine workers the prevalence of subjects with detectable serum anti HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) is higher than in general population [13] , but data regarding seroprevalence might be affected by the different kits used for the analysis, showing significant variability in levels of sensitivity. Therefore, the real incidence of HEV infection in the general population and among workers cannot be estimated yet and further research is needed. Collecting this information is also particularly important because HEV might have a dramatic impact on human health, and in particular in pregnant women. During a HEV outbreak among a group of displaced persons in Darfur, Sudan, 253 HEV cases were recorded in a 6-month period. Among them, 61 were pregnant women, and in this subgroup 19 (31.1%) died from the infection. Regarding ecological factors, it seems that a milder climate due to global climatic change may be followed by an increase in the areas of distribution of major disease vectors, i.e., ticks and mosquitoes, together with an increase in areas already colonized, in the number of vectors. Moreover, milder climatic conditions prolong the seasonal period of activity of vectors and hence the period in which pathogen transmission can take place. An increased number of vectors in areas where wild and cash animals are currently present increases the possibility of transmission of wild animal diseases to domestic animals and bring wild animal biological agents to agricultural settlements, places where the presence of the risk is not anticipated and therefore not addressed by any preventive intervention. Specific examples of the association between climate changes and zoonoses are the recent emergence of arthropod-borne infections like the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) group of encephalitis, Lyme borreliosis and Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, infections and anaplasmoses [14] . It is easily arguable that these diseases might pose a risk to agricultural workers.\\nAn ecological factor having a significant impact on biological risk is represented by the fast degradation of the natural environment and, in particular, deforestation affecting developing countries. In fact, deforestation forces wildlife species to move to new areas, sometimes into suburban zones, increasing www.e-shaw.org the possibilities of contact with humans, cash animals and pets [15] , with a risk of transmission of wildlife infections to these animals and possibly to humans. A similar impact on public health is due to human behavior, and in particular to animal population or repopulation strategies based on the introduction of selected animal species in specific areas for promoting fauna diversity or for hunting purposes [16] . In line with the health problems related to species migration or introduction in new areas, there is species translocation among continents, often accompanied by the movement of infectious agents, which may lead to unexpected exchanges of genetic material. For example, it seems that in the 1980s, a commensal E. coli of the human intestine acquired an aggravated pathogenic capacity becoming verocytotoxic (E. coli O157:H7), due to an exchange of genetic material with a bacteria from the Shigella genus.\\nEnvironmental pollution may expose wildlife species to infectious agents that can be disseminated. Open-air landfill sites, manure dispersal and, more recently, the attitude of some breeders of wasting in the environment without costs, the carcasses of the animals sacrificed in as preventive measure against bovine spongiform encephalopathy diffusion, represented very good opportunities for foxes, stray dogs, prey birds as well as marauders, especially seagulls, to pick up and disperse pathogenic agents, such as enterobacteria, mycobacteria, brucelles and other biological agents [17] .\\nMycobacterial infection is still a prevalent problem in cow breeding enterprises, as demonstrated by several reported outbreaks such as, the recent ones of M. bovis observed in the region of Lombardy (Italy) with a report of 37 cases from 2006-2008 (Table 2 ). Taking into account that the Mycobacterial infection can be transmitted to humans, these data clearly demonstrate that M. bovis is still an occupational problem in developed countries.\\nZoonoses are also suspected to bring about an increased risk of cancer, as suggested by some epidemiological data signifying that veterinarians, meat inspectors and slaughterhouse workers experience an increased risk of myelolymphoproliferative disorders attributed, by epidemiological studies carried out in the eighties, to contact with animal oncoviruses [18] . The data still needs to be confirmed, but we note that a potential exposure to zoonotic viruses is present in the agricultural environment. Examples of these viruses are herpes, a causal factor of Marek's disease in poultry, Avian Leukosis, and papilloma in cattle. Moreover, the rapid expansion of information on retroviruses indicates that other zoonoses viruses will be identified. Identification of the Bovine Leukemia virus as the etiologic agent of the adult form of bovine Lymphosarcoma has also been made. Other viruses to be addressed by research belong to the genera Alpharetrovirus, Betaretrovirus, Gammaretrovirus, and Deltaretrovirus. All of them have been identified as causes of malignant diseases in animals. The Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus and Enzootic Nasal Tumor Virus also deserve attention [19] .\\nThe idea that slaughterhouse workers should be considered as a group particularly at risk has been presented in the recent report of an outbreak of peripheral neuropathy observed in pig abattoirs [20] . Between November 2006 and May 2008, two swine abattoirs from Minnesota and Indiana were affected by a subacute neurological syndrome. The two workers had an occupational exposure to aerosolised porcine brain. The neurological disorder described seems to have an autoimmune origin in response to multiple aerosolised porcine brain tissue antigens; the pattern of nerve involvement suggests a vulnerability of nerve roots and terminals where the blood-nerve barrier is most permeable.\\nIn some countries, the re-emergence of bacterial zoonoses may be due to a lack of surveillance or a lack of appropriate control measures by public services [21] . This can involve an occupational issue. It can be easily assumed that when agricultural workers are not involved in health surveillance protocols, or existing health surveillance protocols do not take into account biological agents, the risk of zoonoses is higher. Occu- www.e-shaw.org pational risk also increases when governments lack resources to enforce hygiene or security standards in slaughterhouses or shelters, leading to an increase in cases of brucellosis, Q-fever or anthrax among workers during certain periods or in specific countries. Finally, it must be taken into account that most occupational risks are reported in agriculture, an area where underreporting of occupational diseases is well known. This includes occupational zoonoses, and can lead to underestimation of the real burden of disease attributable to biological risk in agriculture. Agriculture represents a good model to explain this trend. In fact, the agricultural sector is characterized by small size and family-run enterprises. This leads to a difficult evaluation of the exposures and a lack of health surveillance of the workers. The experience of our center, the International Center For Rural Health, fully supports this claim. For example, a case of \"Milker's Nodule\" was observed in a young cow milker. The man came to our attention through a medical examination performed as part of a program of periodical health surveillance at the workplace. During the patient's examination, a 1 × 1 cm papule at the 4th finger of the right hand, characterized by light rose-yellowish color, surrounded by an erythematous area was noticed. The patient told us that he and his colleagues had already suffered from the same symptom several times, and was well aware that the disease comes from cows. Therefore, after a consultation with the veterinarian in charge of the breeding farm, we knew that an epidemic of the cow parapox infection was present at the farm. In collaboration with the veterinarian, we diagnosed the parapox virus lesion (\"Cow Milker's Nodule) (Fig. 1) . The lesion disappeared spontaneously, as anticipated, but the preventive intervention by us and the veterinarian avoided any further infection in animals and/or workers. This example shows that some zoonotic diseases can actually be transmitted from animals to workers, and vice versa, and that the abililty to detect early signals is fundamental in prevention. In this case, the signal was not detected early [22] .\\nAnother interesting finding of our center comes from the evaluation of the immune system function in cow and pig breeders. The study showed a statistically significant increase in serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 and total serum proteins compared to non-breeders, suggesting a condition of immune activation in animal breeders, which might be indicative of contact with different biological agents [personal unpublished data]. Based on our experience and on a literature review, zoonoses should be considered as an emerging risk in agriculture and animal breeding and should be addressed by specific preventive interventions, in particular, by an early and accurate detection of new outbreaks of epidemic diseases, including emerging zoonoses. The ability to understand the underlying causes of the emergence of diseases and the ecology of the agents and their hosts is urgently needed. Fulfilling these needs is the only way to support an effective prevention or a rapid containment of possible emerging events.\\nThe only promising approach to adequately tackle the problem is the creation, of adequate systems for early detection warnings, to interpret them and to prepare adequate control measures. Since health risks in agriculture and animal breeding affects animals, workers and consumers, and prevention involves several different disciplines, it is evident that a holistic approach is needed, in which all the factors of prevention in agriculture are involved.\\nIn this light, the concept, defined as the \"One Medicine\" by Schwabe [23] , has seen an unprecedented revival in the last decade and has evolved towards \"One Health\" conceptual thinking, emphasizing epidemiology and public health [24] .\\nThis approach is the key to defeating emerging and reemerging zoonoses at the interface between the health of humans, animals and the ecosystem. It supports and legitimizes improved cooperation between animal, public and environmental health. It also gives rise to a new call for the strengthening of animal and human health systems, without which diseases cannot be controlled or defeated [25] .\\nRegarding the collaboration between different disciplines, www.e-shaw.org it is important to mention Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), the German physician and pathologist, who, in the last century said that \"between animal and human medicine there are no dividing lines-nor should there be. The object is different but the experience obtained constitutes the basis of all medicine\" [26] . Virchow was not only the founder of (or 'father of ') comparative medicine but he also coined the term \"zoonoses\". Today there is still no generally accepted definition of One Health. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Office International des Epizooties (OIE), WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and The World Bank in their \"Strategic Framework on One Health\" established in 2008 that One Health is: the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and environment [27] . However, this definition has not been unanimously accepted, as some consider that it is too broad since it includes environmental health.\\nIn conclusion, what is important to highlight is that the \"One Health\" concept is a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment. However, the \"One Health Approach\" remains little known outside of special sectors and institutions concerned with infectious diseases and especially zoonoses. National and regional public health sectors should give priority to surveillance systems and enhanced diagnostics regarding emerging pathogens. A broad collaboration among clinicians, public health workers, veterinary medicine and veterinary public health officials is necessary for prompt response strategies ensuring the prevention and management of such infections [28] . Moreover, developed countries should invest in the establishment and strengthening of surveillance systems in resource-limited countries, considering the international significance of emerging zoonoses. Based on the new international health regulations, emphasis should be to build the appropriate awareness and response capacity in all countries and on promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and coordination. Integrating the early warning systems of international organizations should be undertaken to facilitate the detection of outbreaks of communicable diseases of international public health importance [6] . Finally, the reduction of zoonotic risks in farms should be a priority in order to improve the overall health of humans and animals. To achieve this purpose a close cooperation and interaction between veterinarians, occupational health physicians and public health operators is necessary.\\n\n",

Nasal secretions randomly collected during the cold season were tested via PCR, and this data collection was followed by nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons. In shelter #1 (poor sanitary and nutritional conditions, high animal density and constant contact between dogs), 78% (58/74) of the nasal samples were positive, 35% (26/74) of which were in single infections and 44% (32/74) of which were in coinfections.

       "full_text    Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) may be associated with single virus infections or with a multifactorial etiology and are assigned to infectious agents that replicate sequentially or in synergy. 1 The main viral agents involved in CIRD include Canine distemper virus (CDV), Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) and Canid herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1). 2 In Brazil, CDV infection is endemic in dog populations, is associated with respiratory and/or multisystemic disease, and causes thousands of deaths each year. 3, 4 Due to its impact on animal health, CDV is one of the most important infectious diseases in dogs. 2, 5 Similarly to CDV, CAdV-2 has a worldwide distribution and is a major agent of canine infectious tracheobronchitis (CIT) or \"kennel cough\", a disease characterized by restricted infection of the respiratory system. 6 CPIV has a wide distribution in canine populations with an estimated seroprevalence ranging from 30 to 70%. 7 CPIV infection is related to high population density; the virus is highly transmissible and presents with rapid dissemination between animals. 2 CaHV-1 has a worldwide distribution and is associated with respiratory and reproductive disease. 8 Like other Alphaherpesviruses, CaHV-1 establishes latent infections in nerve ganglia and can periodically reactivate the infection. 9 An estimated 30-100% of domestic dogs have antibodies to CaHV-1. 10 The transmission of respiratory viruses occurs through direct or indirect contact between animals, primarily through contaminated nasal secretions and aerosols. 1 CIRD may affect dogs of both genders and ages; puppies under 90 days old are more susceptible, as well as immunosuppressed dogs, animals without a history of vaccination; vaccination failures or maternal immunity may also contribute. 11 The disease presents a seasonal pattern with a higher incidence in cold months. 12 The diagnosis of CIRD is largely based on the epidemiology, clinical signs and response to therapy. However, an etiologic diagnosis requires the identification of the agent or its products (proteins or nucleic acids). 4 Vaccination is largely used to prevent or control respiratory infections in dogs and helps minimize clinical disease; however, current vaccines are not always effective. 11 In Brazil, despite the wide distribution of these infections and informal reports by veterinarians, very few reports describe viral respiratory disease in dogs. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Additionally, there is little information regarding these infections in local environments with high densities and constant animal movement such as dog shelters. The identification of the more common respiratory viruses in dogs in various epidemiological conditions is essential for developing efficient control and prevention measures.\\nThus, the objective of this study was to investigate respiratory viral infections in dogs in shelters. For this, three shelters located in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, presenting diverse sanitary and nutrition conditions were included in an attempt to associate the occurrence of viral infections with the conditions observed. The viruses were detected in nasal secretions via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and focused on the main agents involved in this condition (CDV, CPIV, CAdV-2 and CaHV-1).\\nDogs from three shelters located in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), Brazil, were included in this study. Two shelters (#1 and #2) are located in Cachoeira do Sul (30 • 02 21 S and 52 • 53 38 W), and one shelter (#3) is located in Passo Fundo (28 • 15 46 S and 52 • 24 24 W). The sample collection was performed in 2014 in months of low temperatures (July and August). Fig. 1 illustrates the environmental conditions observed in these shelters. Shelter selection was performed to include a variety of shelter conditions, including those with low temperature seasons, varying population densities (to take into account the appearance and frequency of cleaning of the premises), and the nutritional states of the dogs (taking into consideration the type of food and the frequency of feeding according to healthy/unhealthy animal appearance). The selection of the animals within each shelter was performed randomly.\\nShelter #1 hosts stray dogs and cats of both genders, of all ages and primarily crossbred animals. The animal population of the shelter was 150 dogs and 30 cats on the date of sampling. The young dogs (six months up to two years old) and adults (more than two years old) were maintained in individual cages/small barns held by leashes in an open space, and most animals had direct and indirect contact with each other. Small, medium and large dogs had individual cages/houses shelters within the same area (approximately 1 m 2 ). Puppies were maintained in collective cages indoors without direct contact with adult animals. Shelter #1 was visited in the cold season when the temperatures ranged of 5-10 • C. At the visit, several animals presented with nasal discharge, indicating respiratory infection. Sanitary and nutritional conditions were inadequate, and the locality had not recently been cleaned. The animals did not receive good quality food and were not fed sufficient amounts.\\nShelter #2 hosts stray dogs of both genders independent of age and primarily crossbred animals. On the day of the visit, the number of animals was 70. During the day, the animals remained outdoors in fenced areas or held by leashes and were grouped according to gender and age. During the night, the animals were allocated indoors, in collective cages, with approximately 10 animals/cage. The dogs had a wide area in which to run and exercise during the day and had contact with each other. Shelter #2 was visited when the outdoor temperatures were between 10 and 15 • C. The sanitary and nutritional conditions were fair to good; the animals were fed once per day, and the cages were cleaned three times per week.\\nShelter #3 hosts stray dogs and cats of both genders, varying ages and primarily crossbred animals. At the visit, 180 dogs and 20 cats were present in the shelter. The dogs were allocated according to gender and age in collective fenced barns that had at least one dog house per animal. The animals had constant direct contact with other animals from the same cage/barn. The individual area was approximately Nasal swabs of 74, 35 and 77 dogs in shelters #1, #2 and #3, respectively, were randomly collected; approximately 50% of the dogs in each shelter were sampled. After sample collection, the swabs were maintained in RNAlater solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the samples remained in dry ice during transport to the laboratory where they were stored at −80 • C. All proceedings involving animal manipulation were performed under the supervision of a veterinarian and according to the recommendations of the Brazilian Committee of Animal Experimentation (Comitê Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal -COBEA, law #6.638, May 8, 1979) . This research was approved by the institutional Ethics and Animal Welfare Committee (UFSM, Comitê de Ética e Experimentação Animal: approval number 080/2014).\\nRNA and DNA extraction from nasal swabs were performed using an RTP DNA/RNA virus extraction kit (Invitek, Hayward, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After RNA extraction, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using an enzyme Super Script III Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR reactions were initially standardized to optimize the concentration of each reagent. Viruses obtained from two commercial vaccines were used as controls for CDV, CPIV and CAdV-2. For CaHV-1, nucleic acid extracted from the liver of a puppy naturally infected with CaHV-1 was used as a control. 17 Ultrapure water was used as a negative control in all reactions. The primers used in all reactions are described in Table 1 . All reactions were performed using a total volume of 25 L with 2 L of total DNA (100-200 ng) according to the PCR conditions described for each virus. Primers to CPIV were obtained using the Clone Manager 7 program (http://www.scied.com), and the sequences are shown in Table 1 For nucleotide sequencing, 90 L of each PCR product was purified using a PureLink ® Quick Gel Extraction and PCR purification Combo Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Positive samples were randomly selected and sequenced in quadruplicates in an automatic sequencer ABI-PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The obtained sequences were analyzed using the Staden Package for consensus sequences achievement. 22 The matrix of sample identity with sequences deposited in GenBank was performed using the BioEdit \\nThe present study investigated the presence of respiratory viruses in dogs of three shelters in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, through virus detection in nasal secretions via PCR.\\nConsidering the previous serological studies on canine respiratory viruses in Brazil, 14, 15 the primary difference of the present study was the direct demonstration and identification of the viruses involved in CIRD.\\nOur results showed the occurrence of the main canine respiratory viruses in these shelters with varying frequencies and combinations of single and mixed infections. In shelter #1, 78% of the 74 samples were positive for at least one virus; CPIV was the most frequent agent (71% of the samples). CPIV was detected in single (30%) or in mixed infections and was associated with CAdV-2 (23%), CDV (4%), or both (14%). CDV and CAdV-2 were found in a high percentage of animals, especially in coinfections (Table 2 ). In shelters #2 and #3, unlike shelter #1, a small percentage of samples were positive for the virus and only in single infections. In shelter #2, CPIV was detected in 9% of the samples and CaHV-1 was detected in 6%. In shelter #3, 9% of the samples were positive for CAdV-2 and 1% for CDV ( Table 2 ). The varying sanitary and nutritional conditions and the dog crowding/density of the respective shelters may explain the important differences in the rates of positive animals.\\nShelter #1 had precarious nutritional and sanitary conditions, poor infrastructure and poor food quality (Fig. 1A) . In shelter #2, the animals had a wide outdoors area in which to play and exercise; however, the dogs of varying ages had direct contact (Fig. 1B) . Fig. 1C shows shelter #3 with individual dog houses and cages with a low population density and good sanitary conditions (approximately six dogs/cage). Factors associated with animal overcrowding, such as excessive noise, poor air quality and diet, in addition to bad kennel cleaning, may cause stress, which may in turn promote the establishment and dissemination of viral infections. [23] [24] [25] Thus, the poor sanitary and nutritional conditions of shelter #1 may have favored the high rate of respiratory viruses.\\nIn this shelter, CDV, CPIV and CAdV-2 were detected in single or mixed infections, corresponding to 78% of the positive dogs. CPIV was detected in 71% of the samples, of which 30% were single infections and 41% were associated with CAdV-2 and/or CDV. CPIV is considered the primary virus involved in respiratory disease in dogs, 2,7,26-29 and has been most frequently reported in conditions of high animal density. 2 CPIV infection produces pathology in the tracheal epithelium 15 and favors secondary respiratory infections by other pathogens such as CAdV-2. 6 In shelter #1, CDV was detected only associated with CAdV-2 and/or CPIV, corresponding to 21% of the positive samples. CDV replication occurs in epithelial cells and macrophages of the upper respiratory system, pharynx and tonsils, followed by lymph node infection and systemic dissemination that can evolve to multisystem disease and immunosuppression. 30 For this reason, bacterial secondary infections are often detected in dogs with distemper in addition to coinfection by other viruses, such as CAdV-2 and CaHV-1. 5, 31, 32 CAdV-2 detection in 45% of the samples from shelter #1 may have been influenced by the high CPIV and CDV infections in the kennel because CPIV promotes primary lesions in the tracheal epithelium 15 and CDV induces immunosuppression. 30 Additionally, adenoviruses are highly resistant in environmental conditions and remain viable in the environment for an extended duration, thereby favoring dissemination among animals. 6 Notably, a high prevalence of CAdV in dog populations has been reported in shelters without a history of vaccination. 33, 34 An investigation of respiratory viruses in dogs in Germany analyzed 58 samples of shelter animals with and without respiratory signs and detected 22.4% (13/58) to be positive for CPIV and one positive for CAdV-2 and CPIV. 29 A similar study performed in Germany examined 68 nasal swabs of domestic dogs 28 ; in this study, 7.4% (5/68) of the samples were positive for CPIV, 2.9% (2/68) for CAdV-2 and 1.5% (1/68) for CDV. Despite varying frequencies, these studies reported CPIV to be the most frequent respiratory virus in dogs, followed by CAdV-2 and CDV.\\nThere are few reports of direct diagnosis of respiratory viruses in dogs; however, some serological studies have been performed in Brazil. 14, 15 In southern Brazil, a serological investigation of 817 domestic dogs without a vaccination history showed that 43% of the animals were seropositive to CAdV and 27.3% to CDV. 14 A similar study was conducted in a population of 173 dogs in shelters, also from the RS state, in which antibodies to CPIV and CDV were detected in 51.4% and 4.1-9.3% of the samples, respectively. 15 These studies showed that respiratory viruses circulate among domestic and shelter dogs in southern Brazil in varying combinations and prevalences that likely reflect environmental and epidemiological differences between regions and dog populations.\\nIn shelters #2 and #3, the respiratory viruses were detected only in single infections with 14% of infections caused by CPIV or CaHV-1 (shelter #2) and 9% by CDV or CAdV-2 (shelter #3). CaHV-1 was detected in samples collected only from the dogs of shelter #2, corresponding to 6% of the collected samples. Although CaHV-1 may cause respiratory disease, the infection has also been associated with other clinical outcomes, including reproductive disease. 35, 36 Due to the ability of CaHV-1 to remain latent in the host, its diagnosis in dog populations should preferentially be performed via serological testing. [37] [38] [39] [40] In this sense, we detected positive serology for CaHV-1 in 7 out of 8 dogs in shelter #1 (not shown). A two-year longitudinal investigation in a shelter in the United States involving 211 necropsied dogs showed CaHV-1 involvement in 12.8% and 9.6% of trachea and lung samples, respectively, reinforcing the involvement of CaHV-1 in respiratory disease in dogs. 2 The identity of the sequenced matrix of the shelter samples with sequences deposited in GenBank revealed 96 to 99% identity (KU341102, KU341103, KU341104 and KU341105) with the N gene (AJ009656. Thus, the results obtained in this research showed that respiratory virus infections (CPIV, CDV, CAdV-2 and CaHV-1) are common in dogs housed in public shelters. The frequency and dissemination of these viral infections appear to be related to a high population density and poor sanitary and nutritional conditions. These results also indicate the need for control/prevention measures, such as vaccination and good environmental conditions, to minimize these infections in shelter dogs. CPIV infection appears to play an especially predominant role in winter respiratory infections in dog shelters and warrants further preventive measures.\\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\\n\n",

       "abstract     [{'text': 'Ownership of companion animals or pets is popular throughout the world. Unfortunately, such animals are susceptible to and potential reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. Close proximity to and contact with pets can lead to human infections. The distribution of zoonotic diseases associated with companion animals such as dogs and cats is not uniform around the world, and moving animals between regions, countries, and continents carries with it the risk of relocating the pathogens they might harbor. Critical among these zoonotic diseases are rabies, echinococcosis, and leishmania. In addition, the protozoan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii and Giardia duodenalis, are also significant agents for human disease of pet origin. Considerable effort is applied to controlling movements of companion animals, particularly dogs, into the European Union. However, free movement of people and their pets within the European Union is a risk factor for the translocation of diseases and their vectors. This review considers the current distribution of some of these diseases, the risks associated with pet travel, and the controls implemented within Europe to prevent the free movement of zoonotic pathogens.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]

       "full_text    Two features of human behavior throughout history are striking. The first has been the domestication of numerous animals for food production, as working animals for activities such as transport, and for hunting purposes. They are also, particularly in modern times, used as a source of companionship, and in the USA alone there are estimated to be over 77 million dogs. 1 The second feature is our propensity to travel. This trait has accelerated in the modern age through technical innovations such as the motor car, air travel, and international shipping. 2 Human travel through migration, leisure, or business continues to increase in parallel with a population increase and the spread of affluence. This provides opportunities for pathogens to move to new areas and cause outbreaks of disease. Commercial air travel has been particularly effective at transporting pathogens such as SARS coronavirus and influenza viruses. 3 It is also contributing to the spread of disease vectors and the diseases they transmit. 4 As we travel, we take animals with us either through trade in livestock or in the movement of companion animals.\\nIn Europe, the free movement of people within the continent has been enabled by the formation of the European Union (EU) and liberalization of border controls. This was formalized by the Schengen Agreement signed by member states in 1985 and implemented in 1995. This created the Schengen Area that reduced border controls between member states and allowed free movement of people between countries. Some countries, including the UK and Ireland, have in the past, agreed opt-outs that retain limitations of movement into those countries.\\nWhen humans travel, they often take their companion animals, particularly dogs, and these in turn can relocate the pathogens and vectors they harbor. Canine parvovirus emerged in 1978 as a new disease in dogs causing hemorrhagic enteritis. Retrospective serology suggested that the disease appeared in Europe in 1976 and spread throughout the world by 1978. 5 The mechanism that enabled global dissemination of the virus has been attributed to contaminated footwear. There are numerous canine-associated diseases but relatively few are significant zoonoses. However, of these, a number are fatal to humans and control is essential to protect public health. Globally, the most significant is the rabies virus. Infection leads to fatal encephalitis, for which there is no treatment. 6, 7 Pre-exposure vaccination protects against the disease in mammals, and due to the extended incubation period between contact with a rabid animal and development of disease, often measured in months, timely post-exposure vaccination is also effective in humans. 8 The dog is the most important reservoir for the virus, and contact with dogs is responsible for virtually all human cases of the disease. Where efforts have been concentrated on controlling dog rabies, the reduction in human cases of disease has been dramatic. 9 Dog rabies has been virtually eliminated from Europe, although there are examples of reintroduction 10, 11 and cross-border movement of rabid animals. 12 Alveolar echinococcosis is caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. It is a fatal condition that is relatively rare in Europe although there are clear areas of endemicity, resulting in human infections in an area of Europe ranging from France in the west to Austria in the east. 13 The disease manifests as a tumor-like growth of cysts containing the larval stage of the parasite in organs such as the liver. Detection of cysts often occurs many years after initial infection, and without intervention such as surgery to remove the cyst(s), the disease is fatal. Dogs act as the definitive host for the adult form of the parasite and movement of infected dogs can lead to the spread of tapeworm eggs and introduction of the disease into new areas. As the adult worm is very small (less than 5 mm) and does not cause clinical signs in the definitive host, spreading of eggs and human infection can remain undetected until clinical symptoms develop.\\nLeishmaniasis is caused by protozoa belonging to the genus Leishmania. Two forms are recognized, ie, cutaneous leishmaniasis causing skin lesions and the more serious visceral disease involving multiple organs. Natural transmission is through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies belonging to the genera Phlebotomus in the Old World. 14 Distribution of leishmaniasis is limited by the presence of the vector. In Europe, the vector is indigenous to those countries around the Mediterranean Sea. The major mammalian reservoir is the domestic dog. Estimates of autochthonous human cases in Europe are approximately 700 a year. 15 Numbers of cases in Turkey are higher, with over 3,000 annually. Nonendemic countries in Europe do encounter cases of canine leishmaniasis as a result of pet movements. 16 In the absence of border restrictions, it is difficult to establish the true extent of regional movement of animals either for trade or through holiday travel. Monitoring of dogs and cats entering the UK through its pet travel scheme indicated that almost 100,000 animals entered the country annually (Table 1) . A similar situation is likely to exist for most EU member states. In addition to this, there is the problem of illegal movement of animals either by organized groups for commercial purposes or inadvertent contraventions of legal requirements by holidaymakers through importation of their animals. Quantification of this is by its very nature difficult, but detection of noncompliance with legislation or deliberately smuggled animals is a regular occurrence, 17 and the incidence of disease often highlights this activity.\\nThe following sections review important zoonotic diseases of pet origin and the policies currently in place to control zoonotic diseases of companion animals and their limitations, concluding with recommendations on what more could be done.\\nCompanion animals are susceptible to a range of infectious diseases, many of which are zoonotic. Table 2 provides a short list of common vector-borne diseases associated with dogs. \\nJet set pets\\nIn Europe, the key zoonotic diseases associated with dogs are rabies, echinococcosis, and leishmaniasis. In addition, the protozoan diseases, toxoplasmosis and giardiasis, are also noteworthy. The following sections provide a detailed overview of each disease and include evidence of their movement in Europe.\\nRabies is a progressive encephalitis that is invariably fatal. It is caused by viruses of the genus lyssavirus, of which the type species is the rabies virus. 18 All mammals are susceptible to the disease, but only a small number are capable of acting as a reservoir species; key among these is the domestic dog. Infected animals shed virus into saliva, and transmission occurs following a bite from a rabid animal, usually a reservoir host. This allows the virus to bypass physical barriers, such as clothing and skin, leading to infection of peripheral nerves. Once the virus infects the central nervous system, the infected host begins to show signs of the disease and therapeutic options are limited to experimental approaches that have not proven successful. 19 However, the period between contact with a rabid animal and invasion of the central nervous system is sufficiently long to allow effective post-exposure vaccination that can, if administered shortly after contact, prevent development of disease. 20 Access to the rabies vaccine, even in rabies-free countries where human cases occur regularly due to exposure overseas, 21 is essential to protect against developing disease. Post-exposure vaccination is also recommended for bites from bats that transmit rabies virus in the Americas and non-rabies lyssaviruses in the rest of the world. 22 This includes the bat lyssaviruses found in the European insectivorous bat populations. However, the efficacy of current vaccines against the full range of viruses within the genus is not complete due to antigenic variation between the rabies virus 23 used to formulate veterinary and human vaccines and the more divergent lyssaviruses. 24 Where dog populations are not strictly controlled and anti-rabies measures are limited, the disease is a major public health problem. This is particularly so in Africa and Asia where the main burden of human disease falls. 25 Through persistent application of rabies control in dogs, the number of human cases of the disease has declined dramatically in Latin America. 9 For reasons that are not understood, rabies virus is found in many species of New World bats. 22 This includes many insectivorous and frugivorous bat species, and the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus). Due to the difficulty in controlling rabies in the bat population, elimination of rabies virus from the Americas is unlikely. Old World bat species harbor viruses from the same genus that can cause disease on rare occasions. 26 Dog rabies has declined in Europe since the Second World War, but in its place the dominant reservoir for disease has been the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). 27 However, this has been successfully controlled and the disease eliminated from many countries by oral vaccination via distribution of baited vaccine. 28 Despite these successes, fox rabies can reemerge by crossing borders between endemic and rabies-free areas. This recently occurred in Italy in 2008 and required repeated oral vaccination campaigns over 3 years to regain freedom from the disease. 29 Occasional cases of dog rabies are reported in Eastern Europe. 30, 31 These may represent spill-over infection from red fox populations, although there is also the possibility that pockets of dog rabies persist in some urban areas. There is also the risk of introducing rabies through accidental importation where a dog may be incubating virus without showing signs of disease and through illegal movement of dogs. In 2008, an animal charity relocated a group of stray animals from Sri Lanka to the UK. One of these animals developed convulsions and died shortly after arrival in a UK quarantine facility and was confirmed to be rabid, leading to the destruction of a further four dogs that may have been in contact with the animal. 32 Illegal importation of animals into the EU presents more of a challenge to veterinary authorities. A survey of cases where rabies was imported into the EU and Switzerland showed that most resulted from tourists transporting dogs, mainly puppies, from North Africa into Spain, and then driving them up into countries further north. 33 One case involved the illegal movement of a puppy in hand luggage in a flight into Hannover airport in Germany. The frequency of such incidents has highlighted the risk of illegally importing rabid dogs from North Africa, 34 which can lead to the loss of rabies-free status if a rabid animal has free movement within EU member states. Once detected, rigorous control procedures and contact tracing are required to ensure protection of the public and elimination of disease. 35 If the virus is introduced into wildlife, extensive oral vaccination would be required to eliminate rabies. Only after 2 years in which no cases were reported could a member state claim freedom from disease. 36 \\nEchinococcosis results from infection with the larval stages of cestodes belonging to the genus Echinococcus. 37 Two species are commonly associated with disease in humans, ie, E. granulosus, which is found worldwide, and E. multilocularis, which has a restricted distribution and causes alveolar echinococcosis. E. multilocularis is found in the northern hemisphere in parts of Western Europe, Asia, and North America, particularly the western coastal regions of Alaska. The species belongs to the family Taeniidae. It exists in a two-host life cycle, parasitizing wild canids such as the red fox as definitive hosts of the adult form and prey species, which act as an intermediate host for the larval stage. Intermediate hosts include species such as the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and field vole (Microtus agrestis). Adult tapeworms, 2-4 mm in length, develop in the small intestine of the definitive host, and then shed eggs persistently for up to 5 months. The eggs contaminate the environment and are resistant to desiccation and low temperatures. 38 This enables egg survival for extended periods. Intermediate hosts ingest the eggs which hatch in the intestine to release metacestodes. These attach to the intestinal wall, cross it, and then migrate from the intestine via the bloodstream to organs such as the liver where they form hydatid cysts into which protoscoleces bud. Upon ingestion of the intermediate host by a fox, the protoscoleces develop into an adult stage, enabling attachment to the intestinal wall and the life cycle is complete. All mammals can develop alveolar cysts following ingestion of eggs, and these continue to develop to the extent that infected organs, particularly the liver and lungs, are destroyed and the host dies. Treatment in humans is limited to surgery to excise cysts, although this carries risks if the cyst bursts, leading to metastases that cause further cysts, or pharmacological therapy with albendazole. 39 Within endemic areas, human contact is limited to those having a close association with animals, such as hunters. However, dogs can act as a definitive host and contaminate areas where humans may come into contact with parasite eggs. Therefore, owning a dog can be considered a risk factor for infection with E. multilocularis in endemic regions.\\nIn Europe, there is an endemic area covering France, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. 40 However, in recent years, E. multilocularis has been detected in further countries in Europe, partly driven by the movements of dogs 41 and by increases in fox populations. 42 In addition, there has been a trend for increasing human cases of disease in Europe over the past two decades. 43 The UK is considered free of the disease through surveillance in wild fox populations. 44 Two cases of human disease have been reported, although neither was considered autochthonous. 45, 46 Further, E. multilocularis has been reported in a single European beaver (Castor fiber) imported into Scotland. Post-mortem examination revealed the presence of extensive alveolar cysts within the liver of one animal. 47 This animal was one of a pair imported from Germany, specifically a region endemic for the disease, but had been held within an enclosure that excluded potential definitive hosts, so the UK is still considered free of the disease. Qualitative assessment has concluded that the risk of introduction of the disease through further beaver importation from endemic countries is low. 48 \\nLeishmaniasis is caused by infection with Leishmania protozoa. The disease comes in two forms, ie, cutaneous, affecting the skin, and visceral, with involvement of internal organs. The disease can be caused by up to 20 species of Leishmania. The most prevalent cause of zoonotic disease is L. infantum. 1 The principal means of transmission in Europe is through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies, eg, Phlebotomus perniciosus, which inoculates a mammalian host with Leishmania protozoa. In South America, Leishmania is transmitted by phlebotomine flies belonging to the genus Lutzomyia. Skin lesions form at the site of the insect bite and progressively increase in size to the point where they can be disfiguring. 49 Visceral leishmaniasis with widespread dissemination of the Leishmania protozoa is more serious, and can be fatal in humans if untreated. Dogs are particularly susceptible to infection with L. infantum, often causing fatalities, 50 and if suspected, the dog should be treated aggressively to control the infection. A range of treatments are available, including meglumine antimoniate, aminosidine, and miltefosine, although each carries a range of side effects. 50 Unfortunately, these drugs are not uniformly available across Europe.\\nLeishmaniasis is present in countries around the Mediterranean Sea where the insect vector is present. The \\nJet set pets disease is considered an emerging disease of companion animals in North America. 51 However, L. infantum has also been detected in the tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineous, suggesting that the geographical distribution may be wider. 52 In countries of northern Europe where there are no indigenous vectors, cases of canine leishmaniasis are regularly reported, often in animals that have spent time in Southern European countries. 53, 54 Leishmaniasis is not present in the UK and there are no competent indigenous vectors. Occasional reports of dogs with canine leishmaniasis have been documented; although the sources of these infections are often from importation, 16 this is not always the case. 55 There are no restrictions on dog movement directed at exclusion of Leishmania species from the UK, although other countries such as Australia do have a requirement for tests to exclude disease.\\nToxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite with a global distribution, and infects all species of animals and birds. 56 Felids are the definitive host and the only animals capable of shedding oocysts in their feces. The prevalence of infection varies geographically, and travel in endemic areas should be considered a risk factor for humans acquiring the infection. 57 The serologic prevalence in humans of T. gondii-specific antibodies ranges between 8% and 80%, depending on numerous epidemiological factors. 58 Cat owners should be aware of the risk of infection during travel to areas of high prevalence.\\nGiardiasis is caused by genotypes of the protozoa Giardia duodenalis, and is the most common human parasitic infection, with an under-reported global number of symptomatic giardiasis cases. 59 The parasite infects a broad range of mammalian hosts, including dogs and cats. Giardia is transmitted directly via ingestion of cysts through the fecal/oral route or by ingestion of cysts in contaminated food or water. 59 The prevalence of human giardiasis varies across the world, reflecting notable differences in economic and social stratification, especially in resource-limited regions. The incidence of human giardiasis reported to the EuroTravNet database by 16 centers in Western Europe in 2011 was 3.7% of 5,965 ill travelers. Interventions that include pretravel advice on behavior in endemic areas would reduce this burden of disease. 60 Infection of pets can be reduced by removal of fecal material and thorough disinfection of housing and bedding after travel to any Giardia-endemic region.\\nControlled entry of pet animals via noncommercial movement into the EU (and between member states) is covered by legislation (Regulation [EU] 576/2013). 61 This requires that animals must be identifiable by a microchip or tattoo, have been vaccinated against rabies, and dependent on the country of origin, been serologically tested and a waiting period completed. Details of the treatments must be recorded in either a pet passport or a third country certificate. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to return of the animal to the country of origin, confinement of the animal until such time that the conditions are reached, or in extreme circumstances, destruction of the animal. Movement between EU member states only requires identification of the animal and rabies vaccination, followed by a 21-day waiting period. All companion animals entering the UK with their owners on an approved route are checked for compliance with the rules of the EU pet travel scheme. Until December 31, 2011, the UK, Sweden, and Malta required additional serological testing for a rabies titer and a 6-month waiting period, tapeworm treatment prior to entry, and treatment for ticks for pets from the EU and listed third countries. Pets from unlisted third countries had to comply with the 6-month quarantine requirement. Before the introduction of the pet travel scheme in February 2000, quarantine for 6 months was applied to all dogs and cats entering the UK. 62 During the existence of the pet travel scheme (2000-2012), 80,000-90,000 dogs and around 8,000 cats entered the country each year (Table 1) . Harmonization in 2012 removed the need for serological testing for dogs, cats, and ferrets entering from EU member states, although this is still in place for unlisted third countries. The new scheme stimulated an increase in entry of companion animals (Table 1) .\\nTo avoid importation of the E. multilocularis tapeworm, pets entering the UK following harmonization of pet movements in 2012 are still required to be treated with praziquantel 24-120 hours prior to entry. This broad-spectrum treatment is highly effective against a range of intestinal parasites. Other disease-free countries, including Finland, Ireland, and Malta, also retain this control measure. A further concern in the UK is the large urban fox population that, if infected with E. multilocularis, could more effectively contaminate areas frequented by humans and domestic dogs. Evidence from Japan, Switzerland, and the USA indicate that urban foxes and coyotes are a major source of E. multilocularis in urban environments. [63] [64] [65] However, baiting with praziquantel has been tested as a means of reducing this risk. 66 Veterinary Medicine: Research and Reports 2015:6 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\\nHolidaymakers traveling with their pets to southern Europe where leishmaniasis is endemic are at the highest risk of bringing the disease back to northern latitudes. Whilst the absence of the vector will prohibit the disease from becoming endemic, this could change if the range of sandflies increases through various factors, especially by climate change and fragmentation of habitat. 67 However, the presence of infected imported dogs provides a potential risk of physical transmission of the protozoa to humans.\\nThere is an increasing risk of pathogen spread when borders become deregulated and allow free movement of people and animals. Further, human and animal overpopulation drives the continual encroachment into natural habitats and enables the opportunistic spread of new and emerging pathogens. 68 This dispersal of pathogens into new regions is occurring at speeds that challenge the most stringent control mechanisms.\\nDue to the freedoms enshrined in the Schengen Agreement and supporting legislation, it is impossible to restrict the movement of companion animals through much of Europe. Despite this, all EU countries are able to conduct nondiscriminatory checks on the movement of dogs and cats within the EU pet travel regulations.\\nClear restrictions exist for animals entering EU member states from a third country, but once within the EU there is little to prevent movement of pets by road from one side of the continent to the other. This brings with it the risk of translocating zoonotic diseases. In addition to legal movements of animals, there is the danger associated with illegal movement of dogs, particularly into the EU. 33 Unless entry into EU member states is rigorously policed, the ease of travel between states could increase the risk of introduction of diseases. An example of this is the movement of tourists from North Africa into Spain, and then onward into northern Europe.\\nA major concern currently is that certain tick species, such as R. sanguineous, could be introduced into the UK and in addition bring their pathogens with them. 69 Table 3 lists a number of tick species prevalent in Europe and the pathogens they host. There is clear evidence that R. sanguineous is being introduced into the UK on pet dogs. 70, 71 The climatic conditions within the UK are not suitable for R. sanguineous to establish itself in the environment due to low winter temperatures, although central heating in buildings provides a potential refuge for this species, and there have been reports of R. sanguineous infestations in properties. 72 Whilst it is important to recommend treatment for ticks, it is likely that this is not rigorously applied in the absence of legislation.\\nWithin this framework, there is a clear role for government to provide unambiguous evidence-based advice to pet owners and veterinarians, maintaining vigilance at border crossing for illegal activity and ensuring a robust public health and veterinary response to the emergence of disease or changes in disease prevalence. When changes to the regulation of animal movements are considered, the implications of change, particularly with regard to the risk of introduction of disease must be considered. 73\\nNumerous studies have suggested the importance of companion (pet) animals to the physical and mental well-being of their owners. 74 This includes the need to travel with \\nJet set pets pets as a \"family member\". Whilst these observations are valid, the threat of infection from a zoonotic disease should not be underestimated. 75 The close proximity of humananimal contact and the opportunities for infection resulting from international travel remains a fundamental area for consideration. Notable zoonotic diseases as reviewed earlier in this paper are the causative agents of severe and significant disease in humans and have an increasing distribution in pet animal hosts. Any list of recommendations must be viewed in the cold light of fiscal reality. The diseases listed in this review have often been described as neglected 15, 76, 77 and thus struggle to attract funding for diagnostic services, applied and basic research, or the attention of policymakers. In many cases, the diseases fall between the pillars of human and veterinary health, and thus support the concept of \"One Health\" in providing a coherent response to disease control. Therefore, the recommendations are those that would be desirable in a world without financial restrictions. Perhaps the most effective recommendation is to continue to educate pet owners on the dangers that might be encountered whilst traveling with pets. This would ensure that rules and recommendations concerning animal health and the prevention of disease would be applied throughout the journey, eg, timely vaccination, regular worming of animals, and regular application of tick treatment, early recognition of disease signs, and prompt contact with a veterinarian. Such intervention by owners themselves might prevent movement of disease in a highly cost-effective manner.\\nWhere travel restrictions have been introduced, such as the conditions for entry into the EU, these must be enforced. This again requires compliance by the public and vigilance at border points. However, these are never perfect, so each member state needs to be able to provide a robust response to potential outbreaks. For the example of rabies, this would involve contact tracing of any humans and animals that could have been infected by the index case. Humans can be offered post-exposure vaccination, and animals with potential contact with a diseased animal would be assessed and receive vaccination and confinement until their health status could be confirmed. All these measures were applied when a rabid dog was brought into France from Morocco. 35 Underpinning all disease responses is a diagnostic service capable of rapid detection of pathogens. This could be organized at the member state level or by regional centers that service a number of countries. A further useful activity would be accurate risk mapping of disease distribution so that particular pathways for introduction of pathogens can be identified and prevented. In this endeavor, bodies such as the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the European Centre for Disease Control, can play a critical role in documenting the incidence of a disease, mapping its geographical distribution and making this information accessible to the general public.\\nThe free movement of people in Europe is widely seen as a positive benefit of the EU. Naturally, people also want the freedom to travel with their pets. However, contact with animals provides opportunities to come into contact with and spread zoonotic diseases, so this freedom to move \"jet set pets\" carries risks. These can be managed through legislation, guidance, and education, but no system is perfect and constant vigilance is needed. A robust response to control disease outbreaks must be implemented when required.\\nPublish your work in this journal Submit your manuscript here: http://www.dovepress.com/veterinary-medicine-research-and-reports-journal Veterinary Medicine: Research and Reports is an international, peer-reviewed, open access journal publishing original research, case reports, editorials, reviews and commentaries on all areas of veterinary medicine.

These adapted viruses have sequence changes in several genes, including those that modulate the host immune response. Nonhuman primate models do not require adaptation of filoviruses. Here, we describe lethal models of disease for Bundibugyo, Sudan, and Zaire species of Ebolavirus in the domestic ferret, using wild-type nonadapted viruses. Pathologic features were consistent with disease in primates. Of particular importance, this is the only known small-animal model developed for Bundibugyo and the only uniformly lethal animal model for Bundibugyo.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section':

       "full_text    Until recently, 3 members of the genus Ebolavirus-Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV)-have been responsible for small, sporadic outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) in humans throughout Central Africa. From December 2013 through January 2016, the devastating emergence of ZEBOV in Western Africa resulted in overwhelming societal tolls in the region. The already weakened public health infrastructure of the region, coupled with a dearth of available, approved diagnostic assays, vaccines, or therapeutic agents, likely contributed to the severity of this epidemic. During the course of the epidemic, a number of medical countermeasures were introduced, but screening and validation of these interventions in animal models were limited by the use of host-adapted small-animal models or the availability of nonhuman primate (NHP) resources [1] .\\nNHPs have historically served as the gold standard for modeling filovirus pathogenesis because they recapitulate many features of human disease, including fever, vascular leakage, and coagulopathy, without the need for virus adaptation. Several immunocompetent small-animal models have been developed for ZEBOV, including mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs. However, all of these small-animal models require host adaptation of the challenge virus [1] . Some severely immunodeficient models have been described, allowing the use of wild-type virus, but there are substantial limitations in the usefulness of these models in the development of countermeasures for circumstances in which dependency on an intact immune response is central [1, 2] . A further limitation is that only the NHP models account for the different species of Ebolavirus beyond ZEBOV, with the recent exception of guinea pig models of SEBOV [3, 4] .\\nThe domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is an animal model for a variety of viral diseases, including rabies, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and for several medically important paramyxoviruses [5] . None of these ferret models require adaptation of the challenge virus to produce a lethal infection. Recent availability of an annotated genome for the ferret has suggested that the susceptibility it shares with humans to these infections is potentially attributable to substantial homologies to many disease-relevant human proteins, including viral entry receptors [6] . Collectively, these data provided the rationale to assess the utility of the ferret as a model for Ebolavirus disease. Here, we performed a narrowly focused study to determine whether ferrets have the potential to serve as a small-animal model for 3 species of Ebolavirus.\\nFifteen female ferrets weighing 0.75-1 kg were housed 2-3 per cage per study. Ferrets were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with a ketamine-acepromazine-xylazine cocktail prior to all procedures. Prior to challenge, transponder chips (Bio-Medic Data Systems) were subcutaneously implanted for identification and temperature monitoring. Subjects were challenged intranasally with 1000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ZEBOV strain Kikwit (n = 5), SEBOV strain Gulu (n = 5), and BEBOV (n = 5), respectively. The passage history of challenge viruses can be found in the Supplementary Methods. To account for variations between challenge events, 2 independent studies were completed, with the initial experiment having 3 animals, followed by a repeat confirmatory study with 2 additional ferrets per virus group. Whole-blood, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-associated plasma, and citrated plasma samples were collected from the superior vena cava for hematologic, serum biochemical, and coagulation assays and viremia determination on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 and at the time of euthanasia. Clinical signs, weights, and transponder-mediated temperatures were recorded daily up to the point of euthanasia. Clinical scores were determined on a scale of 0-12, based on coat appearance, social behavior, and provoked behavior. Animals scoring ≥9 were euthanized per the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol criteria.\\nGross pathology findings were documented, and portions of select tissues were aseptically removed and frozen at −70°C for virus infectivity assays. Portions of select tissues were also fixed in formalin and processed for histologic and immunohistochemical analyses as shown in the Supplementary Methods.\\nAnimal studies were completed under biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) biocontainment at the Galveston National Laboratory and were approved by the UTMB Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with state and federal statutes and regulations relating to experiments involving animals, and by the UTMB Institutional Biosafety Committee.\\nComplete blood counts, coagulation dynamics, and serum blood chemical analyses were performed on blood, serum, or plasma specimens obtained from each experimental animal. Analysis of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), nitrite (a marker for nitric oxide production), and coagulation parameters measured in serum or plasma specimens was also performed as detailed in the Supplementary Methods.\\nDetermination of infectious virus in plasma, spleen, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, lung, and brain was performed using conventional plaque assays as detailed in the Supplementary Methods.\\nConducting animal studies in a BSL-4 facility severely restricts the number of animal subjects, the volume of biological samples that can be obtained, and the ability to repeat assays independently and, thus, limits the power of statistical analyses. Consequently, data are presented as the mean calculated from replicate samples, not replicate assays, and error bars represent the standard deviation across replicates.\\nThe disease course of all Ebolavirus-challenged ferrets was closely monitored after challenge. One of the initial signs of disease observed was fever for all groups, beginning on day 3 after infection, which was followed by rapid-onset hypothermia just prior to euthanasia. Next, we observed an appreciable weight loss beginning on day 4 for both ZEBOV-and SEBOV-infected ferrets; the BEBOV-infected animals did not have weight loss for another 2 days (Supplementary Figure 1) . Common clinical signs included progressively worsening depression, diarrhea, dehydration, nasal and ocular discharge, labored breathing, hunched posture, and altered gait.\\nRemarkably, ferrets died at a mean of 6, 7, and 9 days after infection for ZEBOV, SEBOV, and BEBOV, respectively ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1) . Gross inspection at necropsy revealed hallmark features of EHF, including petechial rashes at the skin surface, reticulated pallor of the liver, and mottled splenomegaly, all of which was comparable across experimental groups (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1) . Evidence of hemorrhage was evident at the pyloric/duodenal junction, spleen, urinary bladder, and lymph nodes (inguinal, axillary, and mesenteric; Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2; lymph node data not shown).\\nHistopathologic lesions in all ferrets were consistent with ZEBOV, SEBOV, and BEBOV infections in primates [7, 8] . The most significant lesions noted on hematoxylin-eosin staining in infected animals were marked lymphohistiocytic and neutrophilic necrotizing hepatitis and necrotizing splenitis. Both SEBOV-and BEBOV-infected animals also had marked hepatic vacuolar degeneration. Diffuse immunolabeling of viral antigen was seen in hepatic sinusoidal mononuclear cells, sheets (ZEBOV) or small clusters (SEBOV or BEBOV) of hepatocytes, and individual-to-small clusters of mononuclear cells within the red and white pulp of the spleen. Striking increases of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling in the spleen was noted in all infected ferrets as compared to the control ferret spleens, suggesting increased lymphocyte apoptosis in these areas. All experimental histopathologic findings were compared against historical control tissue from Ebolavirus-naive ferrets (Supplementary Figure 3) .\\nAll ferrets had progressive, coinciding neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia beginning on day 4 after infection (Supplementary Table 1 ). Progressive monocytosis, eosinophilia, and basophilia were noted mainly in late stages of disease. Evidence of multiorgan failure was noted in terminal serum samples, where striking increases in levels of enzymes associated with liver function and markers of kidney function were detected. Evidence of vascular leakage was also noted with hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia (Supplementary Table 1 ). Beginning on day 4, progressively increasing levels of the circulating proinflammatory markers TNF-α and nitric oxide were also recorded in all animals (Supplementary Figure 2) .\\nThrombocytopenia along with increased partial thromboplastin and activated partial thromboplastin times in terminal samples of all ferrets was suggestive of a consumptive coagulopathy. Progressive increases in levels of circulating fibrinogen were also noted beginning on day 4, which were followed by marked depletion in all terminal animals. Circulating activated protein C activity was diminished to approximately 50% in terminal SEBOV-and BEBOV-infected animals. Interestingly, a sharp increase in activity was noted in all terminal ZEBOV-infected animals ( \\nInfectious virus in plasma was not detected in any Ebolavirus group at day 2 after infection, suggesting that any viremia detected was owed to viral replication after exposure and not residual inoculum. By day 4, a mean of 4 log 10 PFU/mL, 3 log 10 PFU/mL, and 2 log 10 PFU/mL was first detected for ZEBOV, SEBOV, and BEBOV, respectively. Mean peak viremia levels (±SD) were 7.6 ± 0.38 log 10 PFU/mL on day 6 for ZEBOVinfected animals, 7.6 ± 0.29 log 10 PFU/mL on day 7 for SEBOVinfected animals, and 6.9 ± 0.14 log 10 PFU/mL on day 8 for BEBOV-infected animals (Figure 1) .\\nInfectious virus was isolated from all tissues tested for BEBOV. No virus was isolated from the pancreas of ZEBOV-or SEBOVinfected animals. Peak titers were noted in typical Ebolavirus target organs such as liver and spleen where ZEBOV-infected animals had a higher mean viral burden, followed by those infected with SEBOV and BEBOV (Supplementary Figure 2) .\\nWhile rodent models for ZEBOV (Mayinga strain) and SEBOV (Boniface strain) have been described, these models require serial passage to achieve uniform lethality. Here, we present novel outbred, small-animal models that recapitulates hallmark features of Ebolavirus infection of humans and NHPs without adaptation: a uniformly lethal, ferret model of infection with BEBOV, the Gulu strain of SEBOV, and the Kikwit strain of ZEBOV. The Gulu and Kikwit strains have been used by much of the filovirus research community as prototype strains for validating countermeasures in NHPs, and thus screening in ferrets may increase predictive efficacy of such interventions.\\nFerrets have largely been used to study respiratory infections such as those due to influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and henipaviruses, in which mucosal routes have been the most relevant means of infection. The mucosal route of infection has been implicated as an important means of Ebolavirus transmission and has also been demonstrated as an effective method of artificial infection by small-particle aerosol [9] [10] [11] . Accordingly, we challenged ferrets intranasally, a commonly used route in challenge experiments, to assess the mucosal route of infection prior to attempts using less natural routes of infection (eg, parenteral injection). The resulting uniform lethality demonstrates the utility of this intranasal infection model in potential mucosal-mediated transmission experiments or small-particle aerosol challenge, the latter being highly relevant for biodefenserelated concerns. A remarkable point about the intranasal mode of infection is that, despite having direct access to the lungs upon infection, we observed minimal evidence of gross lung pathology; rather, the most impressive pathology and viral burdens were noted in the liver and spleen, just as in NHPs experimentally infected via the intramuscular route.\\nHere, we report 3 ferret models of infection with phylogenetically distinct Ebolaviruses that recapitulated hallmark pathologic processes of Ebolavirus infection in primates, including humans, with indications of fever, diarrhea, coagulopathy, vascular leakage, lymphocyte apoptosis, granulocytosis, multiorgan dysfunction, and abrogated proinflammatory molecule production. As in NHPs, we additionally find that there are clear differences in viral replication rates in ferrets among the different species of Ebolavirus that likely result in correspondingly graded differences in disease progression and time to death [8, 12] .\\nTaken together, these data imply that the ferret models have potential utility for dissecting key events in the pathogenesis of several Ebolaviruses and may be useful for evaluating candidate medical interventions prior to assessment in NHPs [12] . Further studies are needed to more fully characterize the events leading to death and suitability for transmission modeling in these and related filovirus models of infection in ferrets, as well as to determine this model's predictive efficacy for testing medical countermeasures.\\nSupplementary materials are available at http://jid.oxfordjournals.org.

As a result, they believe that comparative medicine is an interdisciplinary subject of Laboratory Animal Science and Medicine, focusing on the similarities and differences in medical problems in humans and animals of different species. By establishing animal models of various human diseases, they have studied the occurrence, development, and outcome of diseases caused by the same pathogen in different species, and systematically compared and studied the molecular, organizational, and overall mechanisms that cause these differences in order to understand the nature of human diseases, aging, and life span. They have applied this theory in infectious diseases that have troubled human beings throughout history. In the past 30 years, many new infectious diseases, including AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Lyme disease, Hantavirus pneumonia, Nile virus infection, Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever, avian influenza, have emerged, and some diseases are still spreading around the world. Animal models of infectious diseases are indispensable for the study of pathogen-host interactions, immune regulation, and evaluation of vaccines and therapeutic drugs. There are a few key points that need to be considered in the development of infectious disease animal models. Which animals are sensitive to new pathogens? Will the animal-specific diagnostic reagents be developed in time since the clinical ones cannot be applied to animal models? Is there any animal model for simulating the whole process of infectious diseases to support the research? According to these concerns, Prof. Qin Chuan and her team have analyzed the receptors of pathogens and immune systems of different species and strains of animals by comparative medicine methods. The resource bank of susceptible animals with different pathogens has been established to solve the problem of timeliness in the establishment of animal models. By comparing and analyzing the genome, immune factors of humans and different species of animals, and eliminating the background interference of animals, 19 kinds of pathogen monitoring reagents for animal models have been developed. This has solved the problem of clinical reagents being unsuitable for animal detection due to species differences and the short time scale for establishing models. Aimed at the same pathogens, the animal model system (AMS) of different animal species and genetically modified animals has been established, so that factors such as genome, receptor, immunity, pathology, and transmission have been clinically compared and analyzed. The AMS is able to reflect the whole process of various diseases, which has solved the problem of a single animal model being unable to simulate diseases comprehensively. Under this guideline, in 2004, Prof. Qin and her team developed the first nonhuman primate model for SARS infection, which reflects the pathogenesis process of clinical SARS infection. 1 In 2009, they developed the H1N1 transmission model to predict the risk of spread and the carrying of pathogens in animals in close contact with humans. 2 In 2010, the', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]\n",
       "full_text    The 14th Scientific Congress of the Chinese Association for Laboratory Animal Science was held on October [11] [12] 2018 The main points that were discussed are as follows.\\nAfter nearly a century of development, there are more than 200 species of experimental animals, and more than 20 000 inbred lines, outbred lines, genetic engineered animals, animal models of diseases, and other resources all over the world, which provide abundant experimental animal resources for scientific research. These resources are widely used in life science research.\\nMany important scientific achievements have been obtained by using laboratory animals, as recognized by 18 Nobel Prizes that were awarded for breakthroughs made possible by this work. According to statistics, in the field of life science, animal experiments account for 60% and therefore make a significant contribution to research in the field. Animal experiments have proved that many infectious human diseases are caused by various microorganisms, such as plague, brucellosis, diphtheria, tetanus, smallpox, and so on. These scientific achievements have determined the relationship between various pathogenic microorganisms and human diseases, making it possible to prevent diseases, build immunologic defenses, and to treat various infectious diseases. Antibiotics, drugs, and biological products discov- 4 In 2013, ferret, mice, and pig models for H7N9 were developed to study the virus infection and transmission. 5, 6 Meanwhile, the nonhuman primate models for MERS infection were, respectively, developed on marmosets and rhesus macaques. 7, 8 They also established the nonhuman primate model for HIV study in China used since the 1980s, and the drug resistance and latent infection model for tuberculosis, These models have resolved the bottleneck in the study of infectious diseases study and drug development in China and other countries. [9] [10] [11] [12] In order to improve the reliability and repeatability of animal experimental results, the standardization of animal model development and evaluation technology in infectious diseases has been performed, which has solved the problem of poor reproducibility of animal experiment results. 13, 14 Based on the animal model system for the whole process of Finally, the development of the Gene Mine offers the potential for many new animal models of disease to be developed. Harnessing the genetic repertoire of the mouse species, the Gene Mine consists of dozens of recombinant inbred strains, resembling a large pedigree of dozens of \"cousins\" descended from eight \"great-grandparents\". [15] [16] [17] Already, the Gene Mine has generated several unique models, including for diabetic retinopathy, 18 ulcerative colitis, right ventricular cardiomyopathy, achalasia, prostate hyperplasia, etc. The Gene\\nMine is now based in ILAS, Beijing, where its phenotyping, genotyping and evaluation for diseases is ongoing.\\nNone.\\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-8562-7325\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

The approach is based on the theory of learning from errors, specifically adapted to the control of the virus spread by reducing infection rates using countermeasures such as medical treatment, isolation, social distancing etc. When these are effective, the infection rate, after reaching a peak, declines following a given recovery rate curve. We use presently available data from China, South Korea and others to make actual predictions of the time needed for securing minimum infection rates in the future.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': 'All rights reserved.

Learning theory simply postulates that humans learn from experience in correcting their mistakes and errors (sometimes even just by trial and error), as they gain knowledge on the problem and skill for addressing it. The theory is consistent with the models and data in cognitive psychology of how humans behave and the brain operates (Ohlsson, 1996; Fiondella and Duffey, 2015; Anderson, 1990; Duffey, 2017b) . The importance of this theory stands in that human errors and incorrect decisions are the dominant contributors to accidents, crashes, system failures, errors, and operational incidents.\\nThe theory is based on the fact that human learning demonstrably reduces error rates (Ohlsson, 1996) : wisdom is gained after an accident. Evidence on this relates to even highly hazardous industries like the nuclear one. A good example is that the safe operation of nuclear power plants has been, and continuous to be, improved from lessons learned from nuclear accidents and incidents. These accidents and incidents, in addition to highlighting the role of human errors in their occurrence and progression, have helped identifying various critical technical elements and contributed to the safer operation of nuclear power plants. Similarly, the observation is applicable to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Improving health systems following epidemic outbreaks and enhancing reliability and safety measures following nuclear power plant accidents have to be handled with objective data and accurate calculations. However, whereas nuclear power plant operation has done this by a world-accepted, high standard of procedures, the \"protection system\" against pandemics is not there yet. The key is how to design, evaluate and implement the procedures, for reaching a high standard.\\nLearning theory has been successfully applied to quantify error and learning rates in technical systems, casualties in large land battles, everyday accident and event data, and to human, software and hardware reliability (Duffey and Saull, 2008; Duffey &amp; Ha, 2010; Fiondella &amp; Duffey, 2015; Duffey, 2017a) . The novel feature is to replace calendar time or test interval, which has always been used before, with a measure for the accumulated experience and/or risk exposure, thus defining rate trends and quantifying effectiveness of responses to errors and accidents, and allowing totally different systems to be directly intercompared. Additionally, the trend is governed by two parameters that are physically based: the learning rate constant and the minimum achievable error rate. This is in contrast with statistical analysis ,where fitting to learning data is typically done on three empirical parameters (Bush and Mosteller, 1955 ) , and with the inverse \"power laws\" extensively fitted in cognitive psychology data ( e.g. Anderson, 1990 and the references therein).\\nThe theory shows the Learning Hypothesis that humans learn from their mistakes and reduce outcomes in such a way that the rate of decrease of the outcome (in the present case of interest, the infection rate, R) with the rate of accumulated experience, ε, (in the present case the advancement in the knowledge of the virus, the contagion spreading dynamics, the effects of the countermeasures) is proportional to the rate R itself. Thus, very simply, the differential equation that describes the accident and outcome data with learning or forgetting describes the proportionality between the rate of change of the learning rate, R, and the learning rate itself (Duffey and Saull, 2008; Duffey, 2017b) :\\nwhere ε is the measure of the risk exposure, learning opportunity or experience/knowledge gained; k is the learning rate (positive for a learning/improving situation and negative for no learning/improving, e.g. because of no effectiveness countermeasures) and Rm is the lowest or minimum achievable error rate, which is never zero as the process of error-making and cognitive rule revision always continues. Physically, k is related to the non-detection or error rate in unconscious memory scanning for recall and recognition, manifesting itself in the conscious external actions, decisions and judgments. The error rate solution obtained from integration of this Minimum Error Rate equation (MERE) is:\\nwhere, 0 is the initial rate at the beginning or start of the problem when the level of experience/knowledge on it is ε= ε0. Different data sets are characterized by different values of the learning constant.\\nIt is clear in Equation (2) that for practical applications a suitable measure of the experience/knowledge or risk exposure accumulated with respect to the initial one, (ε-ε0), is needed and that the original or starting one, ε0, is a suitable arbitrary or convenient reference dependent on the problem at hand. In other words, the measure for the accumulated experience/knowledge or risk exposure is technology/system specific. Then, for data inter-comparisons, it is useful to render non-dimensional the quantities of interest, which results in the Universal Learning Curve (ULC) for the non-dimensional error rate E*= (R(ε)-Rm)/(R0-Rm) as a function of the non-dimensional experience/knowledge or risk exposure ε* = ε/ εT, where εT is the maximum accumulated experience or risk exposure thanks to which the error is recovered (the problem is considered under control), its rate having reached the lowest or minimum achievable value Rm. From (2), * =\\nwith K~ 3 is the fitted learning rate \"universal constant\". This expression has already been shown to represent the learning trends for outcome rate data from industrial, surgical, transportation, mining, manufacturing, chemical, maintenance, software and a multitude of other systems (Duffey and Saull, 2008; Ha, 2013: Fiondella and Duffey, 2015) . For skill acquisition tasks in cognitive psychological testing, this same trend exists and is called the Universal Law of Practice (ULP).\\nIllnesses are still around in the world, many of them deadly. In the past, there have been pandemics1 killing many millions of people, like the \"Black Death\" or Bubonic Plague disease of the Middle Ages, and the influenza epidemic in 1918. In addition to these sudden attacks, other equally deadly pestilences have been and are still around for centuriesyellow fever, cholera, small pox, typhus, measles, malaria.... As modern medical practice eliminated or reduced these hazards using better procedures and new vaccines, other exotic variants and viruses have recently emerged, like SARS, HIV, Ebola and CoViD19, infecting and endangering the ever-increasing and interconnected world population. As we evolve and learn, so do the things that like to kill us, but they usually kill relatively few people compared to, say, automobile accidents or the yearly seasonal influenza.\\nTo determine risk from these instances, we can and must turn to data. As a fine example, we have the official data from the World Health Organization. The WHO gave the death rates for \"all causes\" and for infectious (like cholera) and parasitic (like malaria) diseases for some 194 countries in the mid 1990s. The data cover the full global spectrum, from developed to developing nations, from vast urban conglomerates with very crowded living conditions to scattered rural communities, from jungles to deserts, and all Continents. The data cover and include the effects of modern epidemics, and of course local wars and regional conflicts.\\nIn Figure 1 , the data are plotted not against the usual arbitrary calendar year but-as we now know we should -against the risk exposure measure, in this case the population size. This number is the direct indicator of how many people are at risk, and the country-bycountry populations come from the World Bank Indicators. The data are plotted in the Figure with the lozenges being the overall death rate data and the squares representing the death rate data due to infections.\\nFrom these data, we can know the risk of death from any health cause: it is about 1000 deaths for every 100,000 people, or one in a hundred, and does not depend much on where you live. To verify this overall number \"locally\", we can analyze the data for New York, as given in the graph \"The Conquest of Pestilence in New York City\" from 1800 onwards, published by the Board of Health and the Health Department. This is a typical modern city that had grown in population from 120,000 to about 8 million people, and includes characteristics of immigration, high-density living, mass transportation, high-rise apartments, modern health care, national and international trade, and a large flow of inbound-outbound travel, in other words, globalization. The biggest improvement in health has come from introducing effective hygiene and anti-infection measures, and from improved health prevention and treatment (not from wonder drugs): we have learned how to treat sick people, cure problems and reduce the spread of bad diseases. It is an expensive investment and it is hard work that requires devoted and trained professionals. As a result, after curing and containing many pestilences during the 19th century, the average death rate in New York over the last hundred years has fallen to 10 to 11 per 1000 people, or almost exactly the same one-in-a-hundred rate as the world rate. So modern cities behave pretty much like whole countries, as far as average or overall death rates are concerned.\\nInfectious and parasitic diseases are responsible for 5 to 15 deaths in 100,000 people, so average about one in ten thousand or 1 to 5% of all deaths worldwide, the other 95 to 99% or so being deaths from \"normal\" causes. So the \"normal\" death risk is still about twenty to a hundred times of what it might be if a new pestilence emerges, spreads and takes hold without effective countermeasures.\\nAnother way to view this risk contribution is to say that the chance of death might be increased by a maximum of about 5% if a new global pandemic infection occurs where it has not been prevalent before. This is always the fear, that in today's highly interconnected, high-speed, global world a possible rapid spread of new or variant diseases can occur.\\nAll rights reserved.

There was extensive reporting of nearly every new case occurring and great worldwide information available (e.g. at Johns Hopkins University website coronavirus.jhu.edu/map). By late March 2020, the world had over 1,000,000 cases (and still growing at the time of writing) and many thousands of deaths, with the infection having spread quickly across borders, imported from nation-to-nation mainly via travellers, visitors and tourists, and spread internally from just social and day-to-day human contact.\\nLooking at the available numbers, the individual infection risk today is comparatively negligible, with a few hundred thousand cases in a world population of several billion. It is an individual random infection probability, p(I), of about one in twenty thousand. This risk is many times less than the chance of being hospitalized with influenza, let alone catching it, reflecting the existing fraction of world deaths due to infections.\\nBut the high speed at which this virus has spread makes it legitimate to feel worried and unease, and correspondingly, legitimate questions arise:\\nHow does this novel pandemic compare to the \"normal\" or accepted risk of infectious death?\\nWhat is the \"worst case\" scenario?\\nShould we panic and shun other people who may be carrying what might kill us?\\nHow long will it take to recover?\\nThis calls for the need to try to objectively evaluate the risk, based on the current experience knowledge.\\nWe normally can treat the spread of disease as a \"diffusion\" or \"multiple contact\" process, where it steadily expands outward from some central source or origin; or as a highly mobile source that is potentially spread everywhere due to rapid multiple global personal and social interactions. The excellent US Centers for Disease Control simply states the obvious:\\n\"Risk depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people\"\\n(Source: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary)\\nThe data from China on CoVid-19 infections suggest that there is, or was, a 50%-90% chance of the initial infections spreading between cities, depending on location and size (Du et al , 2020) . Using simple doubling rates, the news media carried projections that a \"worst case\" in the USA could infect over 200 million (i.e. most people in the USA) and cause nearly 2 million or so deaths, and experts were hard at work estimating global, country and age-dependent risks, including of death.\\nWe certainly need to estimate or know the risk of infection. As a simple guess and knowing nothing else, let us assume infections are randomly transmitted anywhere and everywhere from person to person, the spread is instantaneous and guaranteed if a source exists and the probability of being (successfully!) infected is also random and equally possible. This is really a \"worst case\" scenario or \"model\", as obviously not everyone is exposed to everyone and not everyone is equally vulnerable. The worst case scenario is, then, that there is no preventative measures, no immunity and no vaccine, and for whatever reason, the source is not quarantined or isolated, and any such infected person or mobile source can and does transmit the virus (or disease) randomly to others somewhere in the world.\\nIndependent of the transmission mechanism, given contact, the probability of crossinfection, then, depends solely on the total numbers of the possibly equally risk-or infection-exposed recipient population, and the probability of infection is also random. In this model, anyone can get it by interacting with someone that has it2. To help see this more clearly, the black balls (the \"unknowns\") emerging from the Jar of Life is one way to view what might happen based on what we have already seen or been exposed to. Here the one black ball (n=1) is an \"known unknown\" infected person or infection opportunity among those ten (m=10) non-infected (\"known knowns\") white balls (m=10), so a chance of 10% or one over ten. The probability of interest is, then, of infection for more people exposed and infected, or N \"unknown unknowns\", and some not exposed or not successfully infected, M \"unknown knowns\") , out of a total of all exposed people, N+M.\\nThese numbers, N and M, vary by city, country, cruise ship passengers, soccer matches or rock concert arena, and can systematically vary up to the total of about six billions or so in the global world. We can also think of it as our possible exposure experience. The formula for the probability p of the event of an individual I becoming infected takes the form, p(I) = Number infected (N) / total number exposed (N+M).\\nIf there is a gathering limit of ten or so people, as in the case of the white and black balls of the Jar of Life shown in the picture, the observed chance of being infected, p(I), is assumed to be about one infection (black ball) in some ten non-infections (white balls), or 10%. This we know. But the sample is limited to 10 and, so, we could also be exposed to one in a hundred, or one in a thousand, or more: how many more infection cases would we, then, expect out there hidden in the Jar?\\nThe method used to estimate this probability is random sampling based on the so-called hypergeometric formula3. For possible gathering numbers of 10,100, 300 and 1000 with one infection source known or observed, the chance of observing or finding, say, 100,000 new cases of infection, p(I) in a bigger group rises to a maximum or peak of about 37 % (about one in three)4.\\nThe estimate that comes out in this \"worst case scenario\" seemingly agrees with the estimates publicly available on the internet and social media of the awful possibility (risk) of perhaps even a 40-70% chance of being at risk of infection, if nothing is done to prevent it or reduce it5. That is a significant and very high risk of infection, and has been used to justify quarantining, limiting social gatherings and extensive travel restrictions.\\nThis inevitably brings fear to the individuals of the global population and the only way to address fear is by using scientific knowledge and data to inform any theory behind estimates and predictions.\\nDuring the early onset of the CoVid-19 pandemic, many gloomy scenarios were made and analyzed but they generally assumed no effective countermeasures to the spread of infections. The infection numbers grew quickly at first, before countermeasures such as isolation, distancing, restrictions and curfews were implemented to reduce infection rates and \"flatten the curve\" of numbers versus time. Sad to say, deaths (distressing as they are) are also NOT the right measure-infections are the measure for the spread and control of infectious diseases. A logical question is whether the infection or death data show any signs that we are learning how to reduce risk?\\nJust like for any accident-the number killed or dying is highly variable depending on who and how many risk-exposed happens to be there, so it is random. In this viral case, the number of deaths also just depends on too many uncontrolled variables and factors (age, pre-existing health conditions, health care system, propensity etc. …) so the average death percentage per infection also varies in magnitude, location and time (as the data clearly show). The correct measure is infection numbers and rates (not the number of deaths), say the number per day. The infections numbers also depend on which country/region they refer to and at what infectious stage (early onset, spread extent, countermeasures employed ... etc.). We already know that if uncontrolled, the increase in infections will rise exponentially, as the rate of infections is proportional to the number infected.\\nAs usual, the most representative case can be based on actual infection data from where containment of contagion has already been successfully applied, namely in China where it originated. Using data reported by the John Hopkins Center for System Science and Engineering, by March, 2020, there were, n= 81,000 infections and some 3200 deaths in China with a falling to near-zero rate. So with a national population of N+M =1,400,000,000, the overall probable risk of infection is about 0.00006, or one in 17,000, (or about six in 100,000)6. Locally, in some cities/regions it is ten times higher, but although comparable to infectious death rates, the overall CoVid-19 death rate in China was on average one in nearly half a million people, much lower than deaths from other infectious diseases. That is a significant reduction in the risk of infection: countermeasures have worked.\\nSo far, we have these scenarios:\\nThe scary or \"Worst\" with no measures: at least one in three people infected.\\nThe real or \"Best\" control and mitigation: only one in 17000 people infected.\\nThe probable Future is the Past modified by the Likelihood.\\nSo the possible probability reduction , or Likelihood, must be considered in a future estimate based on projections using past data. This simple-minded upper and lower limit comparison suggests the individual Likelihood is about 0.0002, or very low. Societal countermeasures reduced the risk by a factor of 500 to 5000 over the inevitable \"worst case\" random spread of infection or survival-of-only-the-fittest scenarios.\\nThe approach based on Learning Theory illustrated in this Section uses the fact that humans learn how to control the CoVid-19 outbreak spread and reduce infection rates using countermeasures (treatments, isolation, \"social distancing\" etc). IF these are effective the rate, therefore, must reach a peak and, then, decline. To look at pandemic recovery, we really need to look at the rate of infections, NOT just deaths since these depend on too many social and personal health factors as already stated.\\nThese include propensity, age profile, medical system effectiveness, treatment options early detection, etc. The risk of an infectious disease is not controlled unless the infection rate slows down, so-called 'flattening the curve\". Once the rate peaks the rate, then, should decrease due to successful countermeasures (whatever they are).\\nSo, the next question is: what happens next and how do we know how effective the control measures are, and how long before they can be relaxed or maintained?\\nIn China, the actual infection rates (increase per day) rose to a peak of nearly 4000 a day in about 17 to 20 days, and, then, fell away steadily to about 50 or so a day by another 30 days. As a further consideration for a different country, S Korea had a different peak rate of about 1000 per day in ten days, falling to a low rate in another 10 or so days.\\nIn Italy, after some delay in implementing countermeasures, the infection rate seemingly peaked at about 6000 per day in about 30 or so days, as can be seen in the graph of Figure  3 . As of writing, (early April) this rate has decreased to nearly 4000 per day (see graph in the Figure) .\\nThe results for all countries that show some form of recovery are reported in the Figure 4 graph, which plots as, E*, the non-dimensional infection rate normalized to the initial peak value, versus N* = ε/ εT, the non-dimensional elapsed time of experience/knowledge or risk \\nItaly data All rights reserved.

In relation to the equations (1) and (2) of learning theory above, the infection rate takes the role of the error rate R, the risk exposure time, ε , corresponds to the accumulated experience/knowledge from which we learn and is measured in days, the time of peak εT, is the time for the rate to approach its achievable minimum value, Rm (the lowest or minimum achievable error rate, in equation (2). Based on the available data for China and S Korea, using countermeasures, the overall recovery timescale is about 20-30 days to attain the minimum infection rate of about 50 per day .\\nFor further direct comparison, we plot also the reduction curve of the world pulmonary disease death rate per day for 1870 -1970 (Source: Human Nature, T.McKeown, April, 1978 as given in Horwitz and Ferleger \"Statistics for Social Change\"). We can simply think of this overall World data over the years, and its reduction trend, as resulting from many pandemics and multiple outbreaks of influenzas and differing virus strains, that have been more and more successfully treated as we have learned to better control/reduce infections and improved effect recovery, thus steadily reducing the rate.\\nDespite the huge differences in timescales, the \"recovery rate curve\" is simply the exponential Universal Learning Curve of equation (3) The CoVid -19 pandemic and pulmonary disease recovery rate data all fit with the Universal Learning Curve trend (which is known to fit millions of events with learning). The infection rate, E*, normalized to the initial peak value, as a function of the time elapsed The key point is that all the data follow almost exactly the same decreasing trajectory and, furthermore, the learning curve is nearly the same (K~3), as previously found for any learning experience on outcomes, accidents, events of any other modern technological system operated by humans. Indeed, the results surprisingly follow the curve developed some ten years after it was first discovered, while working on completely different data. We can claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction also in this case of the pandemic, and call it the Universal Recovery Curve.\\nTo further confirm the URC general theoretical correlation, we next compare to the latest projections for medical resource loads made by complex computer modeling of infections and deaths in the USA ( IHME, 2020 ). As a reasonable surrogate measure, the number of required hospital beds was assumed to be proportional to the number of infections, which daily values were directly transcribed from the website graph (available at covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america). The interval available is a projection from a peak resource use on April 15th out to July 1st, 2020, so to be consistent with the actual available country data. The infection rate per day, R, was calculated until attaining an assumed but realistic minimum rate, Rm, of 50 per day on 10th June (55 days later).\\nAll rights reserved.

Korea open triangles) and the widely used IHME model projections with the Universal Learning Curve shown in the Figures 4 and 5 are compelling. The data fits with learning curve theory, which we know already incidentally fits millions of events, accidents and trends. China, Italy and S. Korea have indeed learned how to control the spread of a viral pandemic. All other countries/systems/people have to do to predict the infection rate evolution is to follow the same trend after first reaching their rate peak. This type of analysis allows countries and systems to compare the effectiveness of their countermeasures implemented to control the pandemics and the related timescales.\\nA word of caution is necessary, however, these numbers cannot be exact and are not meant to be exact. These are just calculated risk estimates, which are subject to uncertainty related to all the many endogenous factors related to the virus spreading, and the actuation and respect of the measures implemented. The numbers provide guidance to thinking about the absolute risk and the best approach to take given the risk is constant unless we do nothing to reduce it! The strong message here is that the rational and logical approach to dealing with the risk of the occurring pandemic (as with any other risk, for that matter) is to limit own personal and potential exposure, and to minimize both the size and scale of the potentially exposed population. This is precisely what governments and contagious disease experts have been saying all along-but is also what any individual should be doing anyway while exposed to the risks of \"normal\" life. A sort of ethics of resilience (B. Rajaonah and E. Zio, 2020).\\nIn the above graph of Figure 4 , the infection reduction/recovery rate for Italy was estimated to occur in about 30 days, by assuming it was a timeframe similar to that of China. The present prediction is, then, that there is at least a 30-day recovery timeframe as the horizon for the infection rate to get down to a minimum achievable level of say 50 per day (as for China); infection rates should be below 10% of the peak (i.e. about 600 per day) in about 3 weeks from the peak. But this prediction can be effectively monitored and should be updated as more data arises. In fact, at present, only very few days have elapsed since the seemingly reached peak rate, so it is useful to look at a future trajectory. This can be done as in Figure 6 , by plotting the data simply changing the denominator of the non-dimensional elapsed time after the peak rate N* from the 30 days (27 March to 27 April) assumed in analogy to China, to say 20 days (27 March to 6 April) or 40 days (27 March to 6 May) for estimated reduction to the (non-zero) minimum (i.e. 50-100 per day). This sensitivity analysis allows to verify, based on objective data, whether or not any change or improvement in countermeasures is warranted, and by how much. The calculations can assume the infection rate peaked either on about 24 March or March 29, the latter being shown as giving the fewest data points (see Figure 6 above)\\nIn this paper, we have originally proposed to adapt Learning Theory for describing the reduction of pandemic infections like that of CoVid-19. A key point is to look at infection rate, as a measure of error outcome, and time, as a measure of experience/knowledge or risk exposure which allows learning. The analyses of the currently available data show that the CoVid-19 infection rate data follow, after peaking, almost exactly the Universal Learning Curve describing the decreasing trajectory of many other instances where humans learn to apply effective countermeasures. More specifically, the learning curve is nearly the same (with universal constant K~3) as for any learning experience reducing outcomes, accidents and events for other modern technological system operated by humans. We claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction, also in this case of the pandemic, and call it the Universal Recovery Curve. It can be used to predict the expected time at which the pandemic will be under control, in terms of minimum achievable infection rate, and to test and demonstrate the relative author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060319 doi: medRxiv preprint effectiveness of the adopted countermeasures.

       "      <td>we develop a new way to predict the recovery rate of infections following a pandemic outbreak , using the basic postulates of learning theory . this theory has been previously applied to outcome , accident and event data from multiple socio-technological systems , like transportation , medicine , military , power grids , aviation , mining , and manufacturing . learning theory simply postulates that humans learn from experience in correcting their mistakes and errors ( sometimes even just by trial and error ) , as they gain knowledge on the problem and skill for addressing it . the theory is consistent with the models and data in cognitive psychology of how humans behave and the brain operates ( ohlsson , 1996 ; fiondella and duffey , 2015 ; anderson , 1990 ; duffey , 2017b ) . the importance of this theory stands in that human errors and incorrect decisions are the dominant contributors to accidents , crashes , system failures , errors , and operational incidents . the theory is based on the fact that human learning demonstrably reduces error rates ( ohlsson , 1996 ) : wisdom is gained after an accident . evidence on this relates to even highly hazardous industries like the nuclear one . a good example is that the safe operation of nuclear power plants has been , and continuous to be , improved from lessons learned from nuclear accidents and incidents . these accidents and incidents , in addition to highlighting the role of human errors in their occurrence and progression , have helped identifying various critical technical elements and contributed to the safer operation of nuclear power plants . similarly , the observation is applicable to outbreaks of infectious diseases . improving health systems following epidemic outbreaks and enhancing reliability and safety measures following nuclear power plant accidents have to be handled with objective data and accurate calculations . however , whereas nuclear power plant operation has done this by a world-accepted , high standard of procedures , the `` protection system '' against pandemics is not there yet . the key is how to design , evaluate and implement the procedures , for reaching a high standard . learning theory has been successfully applied to quantify error and learning rates in technical systems , casualties in large land battles , everyday accident and event data , and to human , software and hardware reliability ( duffey and saull , 2008 ; duffey &amp; ha , 2010 ; fiondella &amp; duffey , 2015 ; duffey , 2017a ) . the novel feature is to replace calendar time or test interval , which has always been used before , with a measure for the accumulated experience and/or risk exposure , thus defining rate trends and quantifying effectiveness of responses to errors and accidents , and allowing totally different systems to be directly intercompared . additionally , the trend is governed by two parameters that are physically based : the learning rate constant and the minimum achievable error rate . this is in contrast with statistical analysis , where fitting to learning data is typically done on three empirical parameters ( bush and mosteller , 1955 ) , and with the inverse `` power laws '' extensively fitted in cognitive psychology data ( e.g . anderson , 1990 and the references therein ) . the theory shows the learning hypothesis that humans learn from their mistakes and reduce outcomes in such a way that the rate of decrease of the outcome ( in the present case of interest , the infection rate , r ) with the rate of accumulated experience , ε , ( in the present case the advancement in the knowledge of the virus , the contagion spreading dynamics , the effects of the countermeasures ) is proportional to the rate r itself . thus , very simply , the differential equation that describes the accident and outcome data with learning or forgetting describes the proportionality between the rate of change of the learning rate , r , and the learning rate itself ( duffey and saull , 2008 ; duffey , 2017b ) : where ε is the measure of the risk exposure , learning opportunity or experience/knowledge gained ; k is the learning rate ( positive for a learning/improving situation and negative for no learning/improving , e.g . because of no effectiveness countermeasures ) and rm is the lowest or minimum achievable error rate , which is never zero as the process of error-making and cognitive rule revision always continues . physically , k is related to the non-detection or error rate in unconscious memory scanning for recall and recognition , manifesting itself in the conscious external actions , decisions and judgments . the error rate solution obtained from integration of this minimum error rate equation ( mere ) is : where , 0 is the initial rate at the beginning or start of the problem when the level of experience/knowledge on it is ε= ε0 . different data sets are characterized by different values of the learning constant . it is clear in equation ( 2 ) that for practical applications a suitable measure of the experience/knowledge or risk exposure accumulated with respect to the initial one , ( ε-ε0 ) , is needed and that the original or starting one , ε0 , is a suitable arbitrary or convenient reference dependent on the problem at hand . in other words , the measure for the accumulated experience/knowledge or risk exposure is technology/system specific . then , for data inter-comparisons , it is useful to render non-dimensional the quantities of interest , which results in the universal learning curve ( ulc ) for the non-dimensional error rate e*= ( r ( ε ) -rm ) / ( r0-rm ) as a function of the non-dimensional experience/knowledge or risk exposure ε* = ε/ εt , where εt is the maximum accumulated experience or risk exposure thanks to which the error is recovered ( the problem is considered under control ) , its rate having reached the lowest or minimum achievable value rm . from ( 2 ) , * = with k~ 3 is the fitted learning rate `` universal constant '' . this expression has already been shown to represent the learning trends for outcome rate data from industrial , surgical , transportation , mining , manufacturing , chemical , maintenance , software and a multitude of other systems ( duffey and saull , 2008 ; ha , 2013 : fiondella and duffey , 2015 ) . for skill acquisition tasks in cognitive psychological testing , this same trend exists and is called the universal law of practice ( ulp ) . illnesses are still around in the world , many of them deadly . in the past , there have been pandemics1 killing many millions of people , like the `` black death '' or bubonic plague disease of the middle ages , and the influenza epidemic in 1918. in addition to these sudden attacks , other equally deadly pestilences have been and are still around for centuriesyellow fever , cholera , small pox , typhus , measles , malaria ... . as modern medical practice eliminated or reduced these hazards using better procedures and new vaccines , other exotic variants and viruses have recently emerged , like sars , hiv , ebola and covid19 , infecting and endangering the ever-increasing and interconnected world population . as we evolve and learn , so do the things that like to kill us , but they usually kill relatively few people compared to , say , automobile accidents or the yearly seasonal influenza . to determine risk from these instances , we can and must turn to data . as a fine example , we have the official data from the world health organization . the who gave the death rates for `` all causes '' and for infectious ( like cholera ) and parasitic ( like malaria ) diseases for some 194 countries in the mid 1990s . the data cover the full global spectrum , from developed to developing nations , from vast urban conglomerates with very crowded living conditions to scattered rural communities , from jungles to deserts , and all continents . the data cover and include the effects of modern epidemics , and of course local wars and regional conflicts . in figure 1 , the data are plotted not against the usual arbitrary calendar year but-as we now know we should -against the risk exposure measure , in this case the population size . this number is the direct indicator of how many people are at risk , and the country-bycountry populations come from the world bank indicators . the data are plotted in the figure with the lozenges being the overall death rate data and the squares representing the death rate data due to infections . from these data , we can know the risk of death from any health cause : it is about 1000 deaths for every 100,000 people , or one in a hundred , and does not depend much on where you live . to verify this overall number `` locally '' , we can analyze the data for new york , as given in the graph `` the conquest of pestilence in new york city '' from 1800 onwards , published by the board of health and the health department . this is a typical modern city that had grown in population from 120,000 to about 8 million people , and includes characteristics of immigration , high-density living , mass transportation , high-rise apartments , modern health care , national and international trade , and a large flow of inbound-outbound travel , in other words , globalization . the biggest improvement in health has come from introducing effective hygiene and anti-infection measures , and from improved health prevention and treatment ( not from wonder drugs ) : we have learned how to treat sick people , cure problems and reduce the spread of bad diseases . it is an expensive investment and it is hard work that requires devoted and trained professionals . as a result , after curing and containing many pestilences during the 19th century , the average death rate in new york over the last hundred years has fallen to 10 to 11 per 1000 people , or almost exactly the same one-in-a-hundred rate as the world rate . so modern cities behave pretty much like whole countries , as far as average or overall death rates are concerned . infectious and parasitic diseases are responsible for 5 to 15 deaths in 100,000 people , so average about one in ten thousand or 1 to 5 % of all deaths worldwide , the other 95 to 99 % or so being deaths from `` normal '' causes . so the `` normal '' death risk is still about twenty to a hundred times of what it might be if a new pestilence emerges , spreads and takes hold without effective countermeasures . another way to view this risk contribution is to say that the chance of death might be increased by a maximum of about 5 % if a new global pandemic infection occurs where it has not been prevalent before . this is always the fear , that in today 's highly interconnected , high-speed , global world a possible rapid spread of new or variant diseases can occur . all rights reserved . no reuse allowed without permission . author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . the copyright holder for this preprint ( which was not peer-reviewed ) is the . and that is exactly what recently happened , as the 2019-2020 coronavirus ( labeled covid-19 or sars-cov2 ) rapidly spread across the four corners of the globe . there was extensive reporting of nearly every new case occurring and great worldwide information available ( e.g . at johns hopkins university website coronavirus.jhu.edu/map ) . by late march 2020 , the world had over 1,000,000 cases ( and still growing at the time of writing ) and many thousands of deaths , with the infection having spread quickly across borders , imported from nation-to-nation mainly via travellers , visitors and tourists , and spread internally from just social and day-to-day human contact . looking at the available numbers , the individual infection risk today is comparatively negligible , with a few hundred thousand cases in a world population of several billion . it is an individual random infection probability , p ( i ) , of about one in twenty thousand . this risk is many times less than the chance of being hospitalized with influenza , let alone catching it , reflecting the existing fraction of world deaths due to infections . but the high speed at which this virus has spread makes it legitimate to feel worried and unease , and correspondingly , legitimate questions arise : how does this novel pandemic compare to the `` normal '' or accepted risk of infectious death ? what is the `` worst case '' scenario ? should we panic and shun other people who may be carrying what might kill us ? how long will it take to recover ? this calls for the need to try to objectively evaluate the risk , based on the current experience knowledge . we normally can treat the spread of disease as a `` diffusion '' or `` multiple contact '' process , where it steadily expands outward from some central source or origin ; or as a highly mobile source that is potentially spread everywhere due to rapid multiple global personal and social interactions . the excellent us centers for disease control simply states the obvious : '' risk depends on characteristics of the virus , including how well it spreads between people '' ( source : www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary ) the data from china on covid-19 infections suggest that there is , or was , a 50 % -90 % chance of the initial infections spreading between cities , depending on location and size ( du et al , 2020 ) . using simple doubling rates , the news media carried projections that a `` worst case '' in the usa could infect over 200 million ( i.e . most people in the usa ) and cause nearly 2 million or so deaths , and experts were hard at work estimating global , country and age-dependent risks , including of death . we certainly need to estimate or know the risk of infection . as a simple guess and knowing nothing else , let us assume infections are randomly transmitted anywhere and everywhere from person to person , the spread is instantaneous and guaranteed if a source exists and the probability of being ( successfully ! ) infected is also random and equally possible . this is really a `` worst case '' scenario or `` model '' , as obviously not everyone is exposed to everyone and not everyone is equally vulnerable . the worst case scenario is , then , that there is no preventative measures , no immunity and no vaccine , and for whatever reason , the source is not quarantined or isolated , and any such infected person or mobile source can and does transmit the virus ( or disease ) randomly to others somewhere in the world . independent of the transmission mechanism , given contact , the probability of crossinfection , then , depends solely on the total numbers of the possibly equally risk-or infection-exposed recipient population , and the probability of infection is also random . in this model , anyone can get it by interacting with someone that has it2 . to help see this more clearly , the black balls ( the `` unknowns '' ) emerging from the jar of life is one way to view what might happen based on what we have already seen or been exposed to . here the one black ball ( n=1 ) is an `` known unknown '' infected person or infection opportunity among those ten ( m=10 ) non-infected ( `` known knowns '' ) white balls ( m=10 ) , so a chance of 10 % or one over ten . the probability of interest is , then , of infection for more people exposed and infected , or n `` unknown unknowns '' , and some not exposed or not successfully infected , m `` unknown knowns '' ) , out of a total of all exposed people , n+m . these numbers , n and m , vary by city , country , cruise ship passengers , soccer matches or rock concert arena , and can systematically vary up to the total of about six billions or so in the global world . we can also think of it as our possible exposure experience . the formula for the probability p of the event of an individual i becoming infected takes the form , p ( i ) = number infected ( n ) / total number exposed ( n+m ) . if there is a gathering limit of ten or so people , as in the case of the white and black balls of the jar of life shown in the picture , the observed chance of being infected , p ( i ) , is assumed to be about one infection ( black ball ) in some ten non-infections ( white balls ) , or 10 % . this we know . but the sample is limited to 10 and , so , we could also be exposed to one in a hundred , or one in a thousand , or more : how many more infection cases would we , then , expect out there hidden in the jar ? the method used to estimate this probability is random sampling based on the so-called hypergeometric formula3 . for possible gathering numbers of 10,100 , 300 and 1000 with one infection source known or observed , the chance of observing or finding , say , 100,000 new cases of infection , p ( i ) in a bigger group rises to a maximum or peak of about 37 % ( about one in three ) 4. the estimate that comes out in this `` worst case scenario '' seemingly agrees with the estimates publicly available on the internet and social media of the awful possibility ( risk ) of perhaps even a 40-70 % chance of being at risk of infection , if nothing is done to prevent it or reduce it5 . that is a significant and very high risk of infection , and has been used to justify quarantining , limiting social gatherings and extensive travel restrictions . this inevitably brings fear to the individuals of the global population and the only way to address fear is by using scientific knowledge and data to inform any theory behind estimates and predictions . during the early onset of the covid-19 pandemic , many gloomy scenarios were made and analyzed but they generally assumed no effective countermeasures to the spread of infections . the infection numbers grew quickly at first , before countermeasures such as isolation , distancing , restrictions and curfews were implemented to reduce infection rates and `` flatten the curve '' of numbers versus time . sad to say , deaths ( distressing as they are ) are also not the right measure-infections are the measure for the spread and control of infectious diseases . a logical question is whether the infection or death data show any signs that we are learning how to reduce risk ? just like for any accident-the number killed or dying is highly variable depending on who and how many risk-exposed happens to be there , so it is random . in this viral case , the number of deaths also just depends on too many uncontrolled variables and factors ( age , pre-existing health conditions , health care system , propensity etc . … ) so the average death percentage per infection also varies in magnitude , location and time ( as the data clearly show ) . the correct measure is infection numbers and rates ( not the number of deaths ) , say the number per day . the infections numbers also depend on which country/region they refer to and at what infectious stage ( early onset , spread extent , countermeasures employed ... etc. ) . we already know that if uncontrolled , the increase in infections will rise exponentially , as the rate of infections is proportional to the number infected . as usual , the most representative case can be based on actual infection data from where containment of contagion has already been successfully applied , namely in china where it originated . using data reported by the john hopkins center for system science and engineering , by march , 2020 , there were , n= 81,000 infections and some 3200 deaths in china with a falling to near-zero rate . so with a national population of n+m =1,400,000,000 , the overall probable risk of infection is about 0.00006 , or one in 17,000 , ( or about six in 100,000 ) 6. locally , in some cities/regions it is ten times higher , but although comparable to infectious death rates , the overall covid-19 death rate in china was on average one in nearly half a million people , much lower than deaths from other infectious diseases . that is a significant reduction in the risk of infection : countermeasures have worked . so far , we have these scenarios : the scary or `` worst '' with no measures : at least one in three people infected . the real or `` best '' control and mitigation : only one in 17000 people infected . the probable future is the past modified by the likelihood . so the possible probability reduction , or likelihood , must be considered in a future estimate based on projections using past data . this simple-minded upper and lower limit comparison suggests the individual likelihood is about 0.0002 , or very low . societal countermeasures reduced the risk by a factor of 500 to 5000 over the inevitable `` worst case '' random spread of infection or survival-of-only-the-fittest scenarios . the approach based on learning theory illustrated in this section uses the fact that humans learn how to control the covid-19 outbreak spread and reduce infection rates using countermeasures ( treatments , isolation , `` social distancing '' etc ) . if these are effective the rate , therefore , must reach a peak and , then , decline . to look at pandemic recovery , we really need to look at the rate of infections , not just deaths since these depend on too many social and personal health factors as already stated . these include propensity , age profile , medical system effectiveness , treatment options early detection , etc . the risk of an infectious disease is not controlled unless the infection rate slows down , so-called 'flattening the curve '' . once the rate peaks the rate , then , should decrease due to successful countermeasures ( whatever they are ) . so , the next question is : what happens next and how do we know how effective the control measures are , and how long before they can be relaxed or maintained ? in china , the actual infection rates ( increase per day ) rose to a peak of nearly 4000 a day in about 17 to 20 days , and , then , fell away steadily to about 50 or so a day by another 30 days . as a further consideration for a different country , s korea had a different peak rate of about 1000 per day in ten days , falling to a low rate in another 10 or so days . in italy , after some delay in implementing countermeasures , the infection rate seemingly peaked at about 6000 per day in about 30 or so days , as can be seen in the graph of figure 3 . as of writing , ( early april ) this rate has decreased to nearly 4000 per day ( see graph in the figure ) . the results for all countries that show some form of recovery are reported in the figure 4 graph , which plots as , e* , the non-dimensional infection rate normalized to the initial peak value , versus n* = ε/ εt , the non-dimensional elapsed time of experience/knowledge or risk italy data all rights reserved . no reuse

https : //doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060319 doi : medrxiv preprint exposure after the rate has peaked ( number of days after peak/day of peak ) . in relation to the equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of learning theory above , the infection rate takes the role of the error rate r , the risk exposure time , ε , corresponds to the accumulated experience/knowledge from which we learn and is measured in days , the time of peak εt , is the time for the rate to approach its achievable minimum value , rm ( the lowest or minimum achievable error rate , in equation ( 2 ) . based on the available data for china and s korea , using countermeasures , the overall recovery timescale is about 20-30 days to attain the minimum infection rate of about 50 per day . for further direct comparison , we plot also the reduction curve of the world pulmonary disease death rate per day for 1870 -1970 ( source : human nature , t.mckeown , april , 1978 as given in horwitz and ferleger `` statistics for social change '' ) . we can simply think of this overall world data over the years , and its reduction trend , as resulting from many pandemics and multiple outbreaks of influenzas and differing virus strains , that have been more and more successfully treated as we have learned to better control/reduce infections and improved effect recovery , thus steadily reducing the rate . despite the huge differences in timescales , the `` recovery rate curve '' is simply the exponential universal learning curve of equation ( 3 ) the covid -19 pandemic and pulmonary disease recovery rate data all fit with the universal learning curve trend ( which is known to fit millions of events with learning ) . the infection rate , e* , normalized to the initial peak value , as a function of the time elapsed the key point is that all the data follow almost exactly the same decreasing trajectory and , furthermore , the learning curve is nearly the same ( k~3 ) , as previously found for any learning experience on outcomes , accidents , events of any other modern technological system operated by humans . indeed , the results surprisingly follow the curve developed some ten years after it was first discovered , while working on completely different data . we can claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction also in this case of the pandemic , and call it the universal recovery curve . to further confirm the urc general theoretical correlation , we next compare to the latest projections for medical resource loads made by complex computer modeling of infections and deaths in the usa ( ihme , 2020 ) . as a reasonable surrogate measure , the number of required hospital beds was assumed to be proportional to the number of infections , which daily values were directly transcribed from the website graph ( available at covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america ) . the interval available is a projection from a peak resource use on april 15th out to july 1st , 2020 , so to be consistent with the actual available country data . the infection rate per day , r , was calculated until attaining an assumed but realistic minimum rate , rm , of 50 per day on 10th june ( 55 days later ) . all rights reserved . no reuse allowed without permission . author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . the

china data circles , s. korea open triangles ) and the widely used ihme model projections with the universal learning curve shown in the figures 4 and 5 are compelling . the data fits with learning curve theory , which we know already incidentally fits millions of events , accidents and trends . china , italy and s. korea have indeed learned how to control the spread of a viral pandemic . all other countries/systems/people have to do to predict the infection rate evolution is to follow the same trend after first reaching their rate peak . this type of analysis allows countries and systems to compare the effectiveness of their countermeasures implemented to control the pandemics and the related timescales . a word of caution is necessary , however , these numbers can not be exact and are not meant to be exact . these are just calculated risk estimates , which are subject to uncertainty related to all the many endogenous factors related to the virus spreading , and the actuation and respect of the measures implemented . the numbers provide guidance to thinking about the absolute risk and the best approach to take given the risk is constant unless we do nothing to reduce it ! the strong message here is that the rational and logical approach to dealing with the risk of the occurring pandemic ( as with any other risk , for that matter ) is to limit own personal and potential exposure , and to minimize both the size and scale of the potentially exposed population . this is precisely what governments and contagious disease experts have been saying all along-but is also what any individual should be doing anyway while exposed to the risks of `` normal '' life . a sort of ethics of resilience ( b. rajaonah and e. zio , 2020 ) . in the above graph of figure 4 , the infection reduction/recovery rate for italy was estimated to occur in about 30 days , by assuming it was a timeframe similar to that of china . the present prediction is , then , that there is at least a 30-day recovery timeframe as the horizon for the infection rate to get down to a minimum achievable level of say 50 per day ( as for china ) ; infection rates should be below 10 % of the peak ( i.e . about 600 per day ) in about 3 weeks from the peak . but this prediction can be effectively monitored and should be updated as more data arises . in fact , at present , only very few days have elapsed since the seemingly reached peak rate , so it is useful to look at a future trajectory . this can be done as in figure 6 , by plotting the data simply changing the denominator of the non-dimensional elapsed time after the peak rate n* from the 30 days ( 27 march to 27 april ) assumed in analogy to china , to say 20 days ( 27 march to 6 april ) or 40 days ( 27 march to 6 may ) for estimated reduction to the ( non-zero ) minimum ( i.e . 50-100 per day ) . this sensitivity analysis allows to verify , based on objective data , whether or not any change or improvement in countermeasures is warranted , and by how much . the calculations can assume the infection rate peaked either on about 24 march or march 29 , the latter being shown as giving the fewest data points ( see figure 6 above ) in this paper , we have originally proposed to adapt learning theory for describing the reduction of pandemic infections like that of covid-19 . a key point is to look at infection rate , as a measure of error outcome , and time , as a measure of experience/knowledge or risk exposure which allows learning . the analyses of the currently available data show that the covid-19 infection rate data follow , after peaking , almost exactly the universal learning curve describing the decreasing trajectory of many other instances where humans learn to apply effective countermeasures . more specifically , the learning curve is nearly the same ( with universal constant k~3 ) as for any learning experience reducing outcomes , accidents and events for other modern technological system operated by humans . we claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction , also in this case of the pandemic , and call it the universal recovery curve . it can be used to predict the expected time at which the pandemic will be under control , in terms of minimum achievable infection rate , and to test and demonstrate the

       "      <td>The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, a city located in central China, in early December, is fast spreading to more than 30 countries (Benvenuto et al., 2020; She et al., 2020) . In less than 3 months, the disease has infected more than 70,000 people globally, and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. On January 30 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. Upon composing this manuscript, the coronavirus is concurrently spreading and claiming more than 100 lives per day. This outbreak induces an urgency to determine the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and implement optimal strategies to control the epidemic.\\nCoronavirus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus found in a variety of mammals, including bats, civets, camel, and pangolins (Ge et al., 2013; Kandeil et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2007; Rockx et al., 2011) . Two strains of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, have been reported to cause severe respiratory syndromes, resulting in deadly epidemics in 2002 and 2012, respectively (Fung and Liu, 2019; Luk et al., 2019) . This current coronavirus, denoted as SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans. (Benvenuto et al., 2020) .\\nTo effectively fight and end the COVID-19 epidemic, the transmission of the disease and zoonotic source of origin must be accurately identified, leading to the discovery of an optimal strategy to control this outbreak. By studying the cases and clinical features from early reports, this paper illustrates rigorous epidemiological models and the associated statistical methods to estimate the transmission rates in different stages and scenarios and predict the outcomes for different control strategies.\\nThe numbers of cases from January 21 st to February 20 th , 2020 were obtained from the daily reports by National Health Commission (NHC) of China. As NHC did not release case reports until January 21 st , the case numbers prior to January 21 st were obtained from two recent clinical reports (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . The number of patients diagnosed out of Wuhan was obtained from the report by which summarized 1,099 cases confirmed by January 29 th , 2020. The case numbers for the Diamond Princess Cruise were obtained from the daily reports by Yokohama Port Quarantine Center.\\nA susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine model was used for transmission analysis and prediction of epidemiological spread,\\nCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 where S, E, I, Q and N were the number of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), quarantined (Q) and total population. The population in Wuhan (N) is 11,081,000. Assuming that a patient was quarantined immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed, Q was equal to the confirmed number of cases. β is the daily transmission rate, defined as the expected number of infections caused by one infectious person per day. Once a susceptible (S) person becomes infected, the status is changed to exposed for an incubation period, 1/α. Theoretically, the patient is not infectious during the incubation period. After incubation, the patient experiences disease onset and becomes infectious (I). The time interval between disease onset to quarantine (Q) is the infectious time, 1/γ.\\nBecause the SEIQ model cannot be solved explicitly, β was estimated using the Monte carlo method, which simulated the two independent Poisson processes: daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time. To estimate β, there are two scenarios to consider. Firstly, the number of cases may only be available at the beginning and end of the study period. The examples used were the Diamond Princess Cruise and Wuhan prior to January 20 th when the diagnosis kit was not sufficiently available. In this scenario, β was estimated by Monte carlo approximation of the number of cases at the end of the targeted time period. Secondly, the number of Q is made available each day for the examples and the number of confirmed cases in China after January 20 th . In this scenario, γ was first determined from clinical reports for the targeted time period, and then β was estimated by minimizing the mean squared errors from 1,000 Monte carlo samples that approximated the Q curve.\\n.

The simulation was based on two independent Poisson processes: daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time. The daily means and 95% confidence intervals for Q were obtained over 1,000 Monte carlo runs.\\nEpidemiological analysis was performed on data collected from the Mainland of China between January 1 st and January 20 th , 2020. During this period, the suspected zoonotic source, the Huanan Seafood Market, was closed and travel restrictions were not yet enforced by the government. Based on the reported clinical analysis for the 425 cases prior to January 23 rd , the average inoculation time interval was found to be 5.2 days and the average time interval from disease onset to a clinical visit was 5.8 days . In this study, the total number of cases, 8247, including both confirmed and suspected patients, on January 26, 2020 were used as the number of onsets (I+E) for January 20 th , 2020. In the same way, the total number of cases reported between January 1 st and January 7 th , which totaled 136, was used as I0 in the SEIQ model. Because the SEIQ model cannot be solved explicitly, Monte carlo simulation was exploited to determine the daily transmission rate β0=0.44 with 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43 to 0.47 ( Figure 1A ). Given the mean time interval between onset and hospital quarantine of 12.5 days, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 5.5 (95% CI 5.3 to 5.8).\\n.

It is believed that an enclosed and crowded environment is favorable for coronavirus transmission, however the epidemiological data is lacking. To test the hypothesis, the recent Diamond Princess cruise epidemic was used as a comparable case study. A clear disease outbreak was reported on this cruise. A passenger, who visited China on January 10 th , was on board from January 20 th and January 25 th before being confirmed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. All people on board have been quarantined at sea since February 5 th and 621 out of 3711 people were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. As some of the patients were known to be infected after the quarantine, possibly due to central air conditioning and family infection, only the confirmed cases (n=135) by February 10 th (five days incubation plus one day diagnosis) were used for a conservative estimation of transmission. Using a SEIQ model while Q=0, the daily transmission rate, β, was found to be 1.04 (95% CI 0.69-1.87) ( Figure 1B ), which is twice as much as the transmission rate in open cities. Using the infection period of 12.5 days, the effective reproductive number on the cruise, Rc, was 13.0 (95% CI 8.63-23.375).\\nThe link between many of the December cases and the Huanan Seafood Market indicates that the Huanan Seafood Market is one of the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2, if not only.\\nAfter the forced shutdown of the Huanan Seafood Market on January 1 st , the effectiveness of the zoonotic infection and a potential secondary source of SARS-CoV-2 that continued to infect the Wuhan people remained in question.\\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 To characterize the zoonotic infection of COVID-19, a SEIQ model was constructed to analyze for the epidemic from the Hunan Seafood Market in December 2019. The first SARS-CoV-2 onset was found on December 1 st 2019 (Huang et al., 2020) , and by the 1 st of January, 41 patients were confirmed and quarantined. Using the 5.8-day interval between disease onset and clinical visit, 136 cases diagnosed in the first 6 days of January were included, bringing the total number of infections to 177. Given β0=0.44, the development of the epidemic was simulated by initializing with a range of numbers (from 1 to 5) of infections on December 1 st using the SEIQ model. It showed that at most one infected patient can be allowed in the model, which induced a mean of 174 infections (95% CI 161-187) by January 1 st . Instead of one, if two unrelated people were infected by December 1 st , the 95% CI would be (291, 318) on January 1 st , significantly larger than the expected 177 cases. Thus, the transmission would be so minimal that it would not substantially contribute to the final number of infections, even if there existed a second zoonotic source. In the same sense, the results did not support a continuous zoonotic source within the Huanan Seafood Market, which would have resulted in a higher overall number of infections in the later trajectory.\\nAs an RNA virus, coronavirus conveys a high mutation rate (Benvenuto et al., 2020) , raising concerns whether the transmission would change between generations. The significantly higher mortality rate observed in Wuhan suggested that the transmission may attenuate over generations. To test this hypothesis, the patients infected in December 2019 were considered as the first generation because most of the cases had links to the Huanan Market, while the patients infected in January 2020 were considered the second-or-later generation. Given the data from December (assuming there is only one case at the beginning of December), β was estimated to be .

Furthermore, the transmission rates between Wuhan and other cities were also compared. Based on Guan et al's analysis of 1,099 patients confirmed by January 29 th , 616 were identified outside of Wuhan. Out of the 616 patients193 had recently visited Wuhan. Using a mean infectious period of 5 days, β was calculated to 0.438 (β=(616-193)/193/5=0.438), which was within the 95% confidence interval of the previous estimation of β0 in Wuhan, 0.44 (95% CI 0.43-0.47). Therefore, no evidence of attenuation of transmission was found.\\nUnprecedented measures were taken in Wuhan to stop the spread of COVID-19. Immediately after the official announcement of the novel coronavirus, home isolations and personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves were enforced. Public transportation was limited and, eventually, all canceled. On January 23 rd , the government suspended all plane, train and bus travel in and out of Wuhan. On February 2 nd , a comprehensive quarantine strategy was taken by the Chinese government. All home-isolated patients were mandated to be hospitalized in the newly built square cabin hospitals, and all people who had suspected symptoms or had close contacts were demanded for mandatory isolation in the quarantine stations. The effects of these steps may not be clear until the end of the epidemic. Nevertheless, an intermediate analysis is needed for evaluating various control strategies.\\nConsidering the one-day delay in the quarantine of the patients in the square cabin hospitals, the SEIQ model was used to fit the data into two phases, from January 23 rd to February 2 nd , and from February 3 rd to February 20 th . In the first phase, γ was chosen to be 1/6 based on the analysis by .

Using least squared errors for an exhaustive search of β, the optimal transmission rate became 0.54, which was greater than the basic transmission rate β0=0.44 ( Figure   2A ). In the second phase, the time interval from disease onset to quarantine was assumed to drop by another 50% due to the implication of the square cabin hospitals. Thus, γ=1/6, the transmission rate β decreased to 0.10, which was an 81.5% reduction from the first phase and a 77.3% reduction from the basic transmission rate. In conclusion, the aggressive quarantine strategy of building square cabin hospitals has effectively decreased the transmission, whereas the usefulness of the travel ban, home isolation, and personal protection is still unclear.\\nTo further investigate the timing of the comprehensive quarantine, given β=0.10 and γ=1/6, simulated isolations were employed to track the numbers of confirmed cases (Q) at various starting dates, January 1 st , 10 th , 20 th , and 30 th . The initial number of cases was estimated by the SEIQ model.\\nThe predicted Q value was plotted on a logarithm scale up to February 29 th ( Figure 2B) . It was noted that all curves tended to stabilize after the quarantine measures, and the time interval to stabilization increased as the number of initial cases increased. Beginning the quarantine on January 1 st , 136 initial cases were reported. Curve stabilization was achieved after about 10 days, with 235 cases reported at the end of this period. January 10 th started with approximately 1,250 cases and ended with 1,834 cases and January 20 th started with about 8,250 and ended with about 12,000. The January 30 th quarantine took almost 20 days to reach stabilization, and the final number of cases, 62,635, was nearly double the initial number of cases, 38,397. It was noted that the prediction was rather accurate as illustrated by the small 95% CI (gray area), and the CI decreased to negligible as the initial number of cases increased.\\n.

The basic reproductive number, R0, for SARS was determined to be 3 with 95% CI being 2 to 4 (Dye and Gay, 2003) . However, contrary to public knowledge, the earlier reports from the COVID-19 outbreak provided a R0 number less than or equal to that for SARS Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . This may have resulted from an inaccurate number of clinical cases due to delayed clinical visits, overloading of clinical resources, and a low sensitivity of the COVID-19 diagnosis kit. With more clinical reports published, the case numbers were adjusted based on the information presented, which gave a more accurate transmission estimation. The basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was then found to be 5.6, which is substantially higher than that for SARS.\\nIn an enclosed and crowded environment, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to significantly increase. The Diamond Princess Cruise provided an excellent case study as the development of COVID-19 on the cruise line has a clear infectious source, exposure time, quarantine time, and total number of infections. The transport of the virus through the central air conditioning system and the ineffective quarantine of the ship's crew, however, raised some concerns. Nevertheless, a conservative estimation of transmission using only 50% of the confirmed cases has proven the high transmission rate in an enclosed crowded ship. This suggested that the initial offense within the Huanan Seafood Market could be at a high level.\\nThe likely zoonotic origin also raised questions about additional sources other than the Huanan Seafood Market. This argument was partially supported by several early cases with no .

Rigorous statistical models were used to test the hypothesis of a second zoonotic source, and the development of case numbers did not support this hypothesis. Though our model cannot completely exclude the possibility of additional zoonotic sources, it suggested a minimal effect by such sources. Furthermore, the model did not support the constant zoonotic infection within Huanan Seafood Market throughout December. If the zoonotic transgression was sustained, a larger number of infected cases would have been observed. Based on the data from the Diamond Process Cruise, the transmission rate was higher in an enclosed and crowded place, like the Huanan Seafood Market. However, similar transmission rate was observed in December as in January. This is likely due to the market's daytime only operating hours, reducing the contact time. This result further suggested similar transmission rate between generations, which was confirmed by comparing the transmission in Wuhan and other cities. High mutation rates have been observed in the genome sequences collected from more than 100 human specimens. However, the effect that these mutations have on transmission may not be observed in such a short time period.\\nThe Chinese government took unprecedented measures to fight the new epidemic and those measures raised global controversy for their necessity and effectiveness. The restrictive travel ban and home isolation enforced in Wuhan was expected to largely decrease the transmission and prevent further spread of the disease within weeks. Nevertheless, the coronavirus infection was continuously increasing exponentially in late January and early February in Wuhan. In this model, an increase in the transmission rate (from 0.44 to 0.54) was observed during this time period. It suggested that the travel ban and home isolation cannot effectively prevent the disease spread. This was likely due to the probable cross-contamination in the long waiting lines at the .

The limited medical resources only allowed patients with severe symptoms to be hospitalized. A low sensitivity of diagnosis further increased the waiting time for a confirmed case. Insufficient hospital beds resulted in a large number of home isolated patients, often leading to family infection. Observing the tremendous epidemic, the Chinese government built square cabin hospitals with more than twenty thousand beds and quickly moved all patients into these hospitals. All people with suspected symptoms or with close patient contacts were isolated in the government-managed quarantine stations. This comprehensive quarantine method has successfully reduced the transmission rate by 81.5%, and also greatly shortened the infectious time interval. The analysis in this study showed that the epidemic can be controlled within a few weeks if the comprehensive quarantine was conducted on January 20 th or earlier. Concurrently with the development of this manuscript, it was reported that South Korea had more than 1,000 home isolations in the city of Daegu for a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is highly recommended that other countries immediately quarantine all suspected patients.\\nThis model was developed using the cases up to February 20 th . As the case numbers increase, the transmission features may change and some of the assumptions, such as the infectious period, may vary. The cases reported in Wuhan were known to be less than the actual number in January due to overloading of clinical resources and the low sensitivity of diagnosis.\\nThis study attempted to overcome these limitations by using the clinical information verified by several reports and relying only on the beginning and ending cases. Therefore, this model tended to reflect the real trend of this critical epidemic and it provides more convincing evidence to guide the control of this disease by the government.\\n.

       "      <td>the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease , covid-19 , originated in wuhan , a city located in central china , in early december , is fast spreading to more than 30 countries ( benvenuto et al. , 2020 ; she et al. , 2020 ) . in less than 3 months , the disease has infected more than 70,000 people globally , and has caused more than 2,000 deaths . on january 30 th , 2020 , the world health organization declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern . upon composing this manuscript , the coronavirus is concurrently spreading and claiming more than 100 lives per day . this outbreak induces an urgency to determine the characteristics of covid-19 transmission and implement optimal strategies to control the epidemic . coronavirus is an enveloped , positive-sense , single stranded rna virus found in a variety of mammals , including bats , civets , camel , and pangolins ( ge et al. , 2013 ; kandeil et al. , 2019 ; liu et al. , 2007 ; rockx et al. , 2011 ) . two strains of coronaviruses , sars-cov-1 and mers-cov , have been reported to cause severe respiratory syndromes , resulting in deadly epidemics in 2002 and 2012 , respectively ( fung and liu , 2019 ; luk et al. , 2019 ) . this current coronavirus , denoted as sars-cov-2 , is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans . ( benvenuto et al. , 2020 ) . to effectively fight and end the covid-19 epidemic , the transmission of the disease and zoonotic source of origin must be accurately identified , leading to the discovery of an optimal strategy to control this outbreak . by studying the cases and clinical features from early reports , this paper illustrates rigorous epidemiological models and the associated statistical methods to estimate the transmission rates in different stages and scenarios and predict the outcomes for different control strategies . the numbers of cases from january 21 st to february 20 th , 2020 were obtained from the daily reports by national health commission ( nhc ) of china . as nhc did not release case reports until january 21 st , the case numbers prior to january 21 st were obtained from two recent clinical reports ( huang et al. , 2020 ; li et al. , 2020 ) . the number of patients diagnosed out of wuhan was obtained from the report by which summarized 1,099 cases confirmed by january 29 th , 2020. the case numbers for the diamond princess cruise were obtained from the daily reports by yokohama port quarantine center . a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine model was used for transmission analysis and prediction of epidemiological spread , cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a

//doi.org/10 . /2020 where s , e , i , q and n were the number of susceptible ( s ) , exposed ( e ) , infectious ( i ) , quarantined ( q ) and total population . the population in wuhan ( n ) is 11,081,000. assuming that a patient was quarantined immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed , q was equal to the confirmed number of cases . β is the daily transmission rate , defined as the expected number of infections caused by one infectious person per day . once a susceptible ( s ) person becomes infected , the status is changed to exposed for an incubation period , 1/α . theoretically , the patient is not infectious during the incubation period . after incubation , the patient experiences disease onset and becomes infectious ( i ) . the time interval between disease onset to quarantine ( q ) is the infectious time , 1/γ . because the seiq model can not be solved explicitly , β was estimated using the monte carlo method , which simulated the two independent poisson processes : daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time . to estimate β , there are two scenarios to consider . firstly , the number of cases may only be available at the beginning and end of the study period . the examples used were the diamond princess cruise and wuhan prior to january 20 th when the diagnosis kit was not sufficiently available . in this scenario , β was estimated by monte carlo approximation of the number of cases at the end of the targeted time period . secondly , the number of q is made available each day for the examples and the number of confirmed cases in china after january 20 th . in this scenario , γ was first determined from clinical reports for the targeted time period , and then β was estimated by minimizing the mean squared errors from 1,000 monte carlo samples that approximated the q curve . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display

were generated given β , γ , initial e , and initial i. the simulation was based on two independent poisson processes : daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time . the daily means and 95 % confidence intervals for q were obtained over 1,000 monte carlo runs . epidemiological analysis was performed on data collected from the mainland of china between january 1 st and january 20 th , 2020. during this period , the suspected zoonotic source , the huanan seafood market , was closed and travel restrictions were not yet enforced by the government . based on the reported clinical analysis for the 425 cases prior to january 23 rd , the average inoculation time interval was found to be 5.2 days and the average time interval from disease onset to a clinical visit was 5.8 days . in this study , the total number of cases , 8247 , including both confirmed and suspected patients , on january 26 , 2020 were used as the number of onsets ( i+e ) for january 20 th , 2020. in the same way , the total number of cases reported between january 1 st and january 7 th , which totaled 136 , was used as i0 in the seiq model . because the seiq model can not be solved explicitly , monte carlo simulation was exploited to determine the daily transmission rate β0=0.44 with 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 0.43 to 0.47 ( figure 1a ) . given the mean time interval between onset and hospital quarantine of 12.5 days , the basic reproductive number , r0 , was estimated to be 5.5 ( 95 % ci 5.3 to 5.8 ) . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a

//doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026773 doi : medrxiv preprint most of infected cases in december 2019 were linked to the huanan seafood market , which retails seafood and wild animals . it is believed that an enclosed and crowded environment is favorable for coronavirus transmission , however the epidemiological data is lacking . to test the hypothesis , the recent diamond princess cruise epidemic was used as a comparable case study . a clear disease outbreak was reported on this cruise . a passenger , who visited china on january 10 th , was on board from january 20 th and january 25 th before being confirmed with a sars-cov-2 infection . all people on board have been quarantined at sea since february 5 th and 621 out of 3711 people were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 . as some of the patients were known to be infected after the quarantine , possibly due to central air conditioning and family infection , only the confirmed cases ( n=135 ) by february 10 th ( five days incubation plus one day diagnosis ) were used for a conservative estimation of transmission . using a seiq model while q=0 , the daily transmission rate , β , was found to be 1.04 ( 95 % ci 0.69-1.87 ) ( figure 1b ) , which is twice as much as the transmission rate in open cities . using the infection period of 12.5 days , the effective reproductive number on the cruise , rc , was 13.0 ( 95 % ci 8.63-23.375 ) . the link between many of the december cases and the huanan seafood market indicates that the huanan seafood market is one of the zoonotic origins of sars-cov-2 , if not only . after the forced shutdown of the huanan seafood market on january 1 st , the effectiveness of the zoonotic infection and a potential secondary source of sars-cov-2 that continued to infect the wuhan people remained in question . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . is the ( which was not

the hunan seafood market in december 2019. the first sars-cov-2 onset was found on december 1 st 2019 ( huang et al. , 2020 ) , and by the 1 st of january , 41 patients were confirmed and quarantined . using the 5.8-day interval between disease onset and clinical visit , 136 cases diagnosed in the first 6 days of january were included , bringing the total number of infections to 177. given β0=0.44 , the development of the epidemic was simulated by initializing with a range of numbers ( from 1 to 5 ) of infections on december 1 st using the seiq model . it showed that at most one infected patient can be allowed in the model , which induced a mean of 174 infections ( 95 % ci 161-187 ) by january 1 st . instead of one , if two unrelated people were infected by december 1 st , the 95 % ci would be ( 291 , 318 ) on january 1 st , significantly larger than the expected 177 cases . thus , the transmission would be so minimal that it would not substantially contribute to the final number of infections , even if there existed a second zoonotic source . in the same sense , the results did not support a continuous zoonotic source within the huanan seafood market , which would have resulted in a higher overall number of infections in the later trajectory . as an rna virus , coronavirus conveys a high mutation rate ( benvenuto et al. , 2020 ) , raising concerns whether the transmission would change between generations . the significantly higher mortality rate observed in wuhan suggested that the transmission may attenuate over generations . to test this hypothesis , the patients infected in december 2019 were considered as the first generation because most of the cases had links to the huanan market , while the patients infected in january 2020 were considered the second-or-later generation . given the data from december ( assuming there is only one case at the beginning of december ) , β was estimated to be . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made

//doi.org/10 . 1101 0.41 ( 95 % ci 0.31-0.56 ) ( figure 1c ) , which was not significantly different from the transmission rate β0=0.45 , obtained between january 1 st and 20 th . furthermore , the transmission rates between wuhan and other cities were also compared . based on guan et al 's analysis of 1,099 patients confirmed by january 29 th , 616 were identified outside of wuhan . out of the 616 patients193 had recently visited wuhan . using a mean infectious period of 5 days , β was calculated to 0.438 ( β= ( 616-193 ) /193/5=0.438 ) , which was within the 95 % confidence interval of the previous estimation of β0 in wuhan , 0.44 ( 95 % ci 0.43-0.47 ) . therefore , no evidence of attenuation of transmission was found . unprecedented measures were taken in wuhan to stop the spread of covid-19 . immediately after the official announcement of the novel coronavirus , home isolations and personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves were enforced . public transportation was limited and , eventually , all canceled . on january 23 rd , the government suspended all plane , train and bus travel in and out of wuhan . on february 2 nd , a comprehensive quarantine strategy was taken by the chinese government . all home-isolated patients were mandated to be hospitalized in the newly built square cabin hospitals , and all people who had suspected symptoms or had close contacts were demanded for mandatory isolation in the quarantine stations . the effects of these steps may not be clear until the end of the epidemic . nevertheless , an intermediate analysis is needed for evaluating various control strategies . considering the one-day delay in the quarantine of the patients in the square cabin hospitals , the seiq model was used to fit the data into two phases , from january 23 rd to february 2 nd , and from february 3 rd to february 20 th . in the first phase , γ was chosen to be 1/6 based on the analysis by . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license

https : //doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026773 doi : medrxiv preprint ( yang et al. , 2020 ) . using least squared errors for an exhaustive search of β , the optimal transmission rate became 0.54 , which was greater than the basic transmission rate β0=0.44 ( figure 2a ) . in the second phase , the time interval from disease onset to quarantine was assumed to drop by another 50 % due to the implication of the square cabin hospitals . thus , γ=1/6 , the transmission rate β decreased to 0.10 , which was an 81.5 % reduction from the first phase and a 77.3 % reduction from the basic transmission rate . in conclusion , the aggressive quarantine strategy of building square cabin hospitals has effectively decreased the transmission , whereas the usefulness of the travel ban , home isolation , and personal protection is still unclear . to further investigate the timing of the comprehensive quarantine , given β=0.10 and γ=1/6 , simulated isolations were employed to track the numbers of confirmed cases ( q ) at various starting dates , january 1 st , 10 th , 20 th , and 30 th . the initial number of cases was estimated by the seiq model . the predicted q value was plotted on a logarithm scale up to february 29 th ( figure 2b ) . it was noted that all curves tended to stabilize after the quarantine measures , and the time interval to stabilization increased as the number of initial cases increased . beginning the quarantine on january 1 st , 136 initial cases were reported . curve stabilization was achieved after about 10 days , with 235 cases reported at the end of this period . january 10 th started with approximately 1,250 cases and ended with 1,834 cases and january 20 th started with about 8,250 and ended with about 12,000. the january 30 th quarantine took almost 20 days to reach stabilization , and the final number of cases , 62,635 , was nearly double the initial number of cases , 38,397. it was noted that the prediction was rather accurate as illustrated by the small 95 % ci ( gray area ) , and the ci decreased to negligible as the initial number of cases increased . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available

//doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10 . /2020 covid-19 is spreading at a much higher rate and at a larger scale compared to the 2003 sars epidemic . the basic reproductive number , r0 , for sars was determined to be 3 with 95 % ci being 2 to 4 ( dye and gay , 2003 ) . however , contrary to public knowledge , the earlier reports from the covid-19 outbreak provided a r0 number less than or equal to that for sars wu et al. , 2020 ; zhou et al. , 2020 ) . this may have resulted from an inaccurate number of clinical cases due to delayed clinical visits , overloading of clinical resources , and a low sensitivity of the covid-19 diagnosis kit . with more clinical reports published , the case numbers were adjusted based on the information presented , which gave a more accurate transmission estimation . the basic reproductive number for covid-19 was then found to be 5.6 , which is substantially higher than that for sars . in an enclosed and crowded environment , the transmission of sars-cov-2 was thought to significantly increase . the diamond princess cruise provided an excellent case study as the development of covid-19 on the cruise line has a clear infectious source , exposure time , quarantine time , and total number of infections . the transport of the virus through the central air conditioning system and the ineffective quarantine of the ship 's crew , however , raised some concerns . nevertheless , a conservative estimation of transmission using only 50 % of the confirmed cases has proven the high transmission rate in an enclosed crowded ship . this suggested that the initial offense within the huanan seafood market could be at a high level . the likely zoonotic origin also raised questions about additional sources other than the huanan seafood market . this argument was partially supported by several early cases with no . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . is the ( which was not peer-reviewed ) the copyright holder for this preprint . known links to the huanan seafood market . rigorous statistical models were used to test the hypothesis of a second zoonotic source , and the development of case numbers did not support this hypothesis . though our model can not completely exclude the possibility of additional zoonotic sources , it suggested a minimal effect by such sources . furthermore , the model did not support the constant zoonotic infection within huanan seafood market throughout december . if the zoonotic transgression was sustained , a larger number of infected cases would have been observed . based on the data from the diamond process cruise , the transmission rate was higher in an enclosed and crowded place , like the huanan seafood market . however , similar transmission rate was observed in december as in january . this is likely due to the market 's daytime only operating hours , reducing the contact time . this result further suggested similar transmission rate between generations , which was confirmed by comparing the transmission in wuhan and other cities . high mutation rates have been observed in the genome sequences collected from more than 100 human specimens . however , the effect that these mutations have on transmission may not be observed in such a short time period . the chinese government took unprecedented measures to fight the new epidemic and those measures raised global controversy for their necessity and effectiveness . the restrictive travel ban and home isolation enforced in wuhan was expected to largely decrease the transmission and prevent further spread of the disease within weeks . nevertheless , the coronavirus infection was continuously increasing exponentially in late january and early february in wuhan . in this model , an increase in the transmission rate ( from 0.44 to 0.54 ) was observed during this time period . it suggested that the travel ban and home isolation can not effectively prevent the disease spread . this was likely due to the probable cross-contamination in the long waiting lines at the . cc-by-nc-nd

be hospitalized . a low sensitivity of diagnosis further increased the waiting time for a confirmed case . insufficient hospital beds resulted in a large number of home isolated patients , often leading to family infection . observing the tremendous epidemic , the chinese government built square cabin hospitals with more than twenty thousand beds and quickly moved all patients into these hospitals . all people with suspected symptoms or with close patient contacts were isolated in the government-managed quarantine stations . this comprehensive quarantine method has successfully reduced the transmission rate by 81.5 % , and also greatly shortened the infectious time interval . the analysis in this study showed that the epidemic can be controlled within a few weeks if the comprehensive quarantine was conducted on january 20 th or earlier . concurrently with the development of this manuscript , it was reported that south korea had more than 1,000 home isolations in the city of daegu for a suspected sars-cov-2 infection . it is highly recommended that other countries immediately quarantine all suspected patients . this model was developed using the cases up to february 20 th . as the case numbers increase , the transmission features may change and some of the assumptions , such as the infectious period , may vary . the cases reported in wuhan were known to be less than the actual number in january due to overloading of clinical resources and the low sensitivity of diagnosis . this study attempted to overcome these limitations by using the clinical information verified by several reports and relying only on the beginning and ending cases . therefore , this model tended to reflect the real trend of this critical epidemic and it provides more convincing evidence to guide the control of this disease by the government . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to

In the scenario, that no further actions are implemented, the spread of COVID-19 is expected to continue slowly, reaching 21,000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed cases, deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days; a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Year's celebration, Farvardin, first month of spring (30 th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the number of reported deaths of COVDI-19 to be between 3,000-5,000 and the number of recovered cases between 5,000 -30,000 from the total confirmed cases in the range of 35,000-70,000 infected cases.\\nConclusions: The Modeling of Covid-19 outbreak shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition, many factors are effective in stopping the disease.

WHO reported that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and chosen by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January. (1) During the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom (2) . As of 17 March 2020, according to Iranian health authorities, there had been 988 COVID-19 deaths in Iran with more than 16,000 confirmed infections(3,4,5) This respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus is one of the leading causes for serious illnesses in people all over the world. According to the global statistics of fatalities caused by coronavirus, and its spread in Iran, it is vital and essential to forecast its outbreak by a model. As the outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), is a worldwide pandemic, it is rapidly expanding in Iran, real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. Previously, real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility, severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak, such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola. Analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters, such as the incubation and infectious periods, and delays between infection and detection, isolation, and reporting of cases. However, official individual patient data rarely become publicly available, when the information is most needed. This is an analysis of the COVID-19 out-break in Iran. In this population-level observational study, I used the Iranian Ministry of Health reports downloaded from GitHub, an online data-sharing platform. This dataset is updated on a daily basis with a 24 hour delay. The dataset includes time-stamped counts of the daily cases and deaths within each province in Iran.\\nIn this study, we will build a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. I will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases, deaths and recovered for the whole country.\\n.

This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree -more recent values are given a greater weight.\\nDue to the lack of historical data, seasonality analysis has been removed from the modeling and the trends are analyzed based on the daily timeframe. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season. The trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time.\\nThe predictive model will be tested against four regression model evaluations for robustness. They are as follow:\\n• MAE -mean absolute error, this gives less weight to the outliers • MAPE -similar to MSE, but normalized by true observation. The downside is when the true observation is zero, this metric could be problematic.\\n• MSE -mean squared error, it is like a combination measurement of bias ad variance of the prediction. For example, bias squared add variance. .

The purpose of this test is to see how well the model fits the dataset without over-fitting it. The AIC score rewards models that achieve a high goodness-of-fit score ad penalizes them if they become over complex. A low AIC score indicates a better fit.\\nSince the outbreak has begun in early February 2020, the rate of infection and number of deaths has been increased significantly as seen in the illustration below. On the 19 th February, the first 2 deaths were reported, on the 23 rd February, 4 other provinces reported COVID-19 deaths, and within the space 28 days the virus has spreaded across the whole country (see illustration 2), by 20 th March 2020, Tehran, the capital city of Iran reported approximately to 4000 confirmed cases of COVID-19.\\n.

The top 10 most affected provinces are Tehran, Esfahan, Mazandaran, Qom, Alborz, Gilan, Markazi, Razavi-Khorasan, East Azerbaijan and Semon, which can be reviewed in illustration 3, province ranked by confirmed cases from the highest number to the least.\\n.

If no control measures are put in place, it is expected that over 40,000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However, if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success, one would expect the spread of the COV-19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario, that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID-19 to continue on a gentle incline, reaching 21,000 by mid-June.\\n.

The base model shown in Illustration 5 is the simple forecast model, without trend or seasonality built-in. It has the highest AIC out of the three models across the 5 sampled provinces, although it has a low MAPE, when compared to the other three statistical metrics like RMSE, MAE, MASE it yields the highest margin of error in the group.\\nThe quality of the predictive model for Tehran is acceptable because the dataset is more robust compared to one integrated with seasonality. The Mean Absolute Scaled Error, MASE is less than 1 for the projected 90 days period which is a positive score for the model. The RMSE, unbiased forecast score is slightly higher than the MAE, which gives a median future distribution of 84. The MAPE is over 100% which means the errors are \"much greater\" then the actual values.

Here we introduce a simplified CUT&amp;Tag method that can be performed at home to help ameliorate the interruption of bench research caused by COVID-19 physical distancing requirements. All steps beginning with frozen nuclei are performed in single PCR tubes through to barcoded library amplication and cleanup, ready for pooling and DNA sequencing. Our CUT&amp;Tag@home protocol has minimal equipment, reagent and supply needs and does not require handling of toxic or biologically active materials. We show that data quality and reproducibility for samples down to ~100 nuclei compare favorably to datasets produced using lab-based CUT&amp;Tag and other chromatin profiling methods. We use CUT&amp;Tag@home with antibodies to trimethylated histone H3 lysine-4, -36, -27 and -9 to comprehensively profile the epigenome of human K562 cells, consisting respectively of active gene regulatory elements, transcribed gene bodies, developmentally silenced domains and constitutively silenced parasitic elements.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]</td>\n",
       "      <td>All dynamic processes that take place on DNA in the nucleus occur in the context of a chromatin landscape that comprises nucleosomes and their modifications, transcription factors and chromatin-associated complexes. A variety of chromatin features mark sites of transcriptional regulatory elements and regions of activation and silencing that differ between cell types and change during development and disease progression. The mapping of chromatin features genome-wide has traditionally been performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), in which chromatin is cross-linked and solubilized and an antibody to a protein or modification of interest is used to immunoprecipitate the bound DNA (Rodriguez-Ubreva and Ballestar, 2014) . However, alternative chromatin profiling methods based on enzyme tethering in situ have recently gained in popularity.\\nFor example, in Cleavage Under Targets &amp; Release Using Nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN) (Skene and Henikoff, 2017) , which is based on Laemmli's Chromatin Immunocleavage (ChIC) method (Schmid et al., 2004) , a fusion protein between Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) and Protein A binds sites of antibody binding in nuclei or permeabilized cells bound to magnetic beads. Activation of MNase with Ca ++ results in targeted cleavage releasing the antibody-bound fragment into the supernatant for paired-end DNA sequencing. The low backgrounds resulting from antibody-tethered cleavage and release reduce cell numbers and sequencing depths required to map chromatin features relative to ChIP-seq, and CUT&amp;RUN is now becoming a standard tool for mapping transcription factors and other chromatin features (Hainer et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Oomen et al., 2019; Roth et al., 2018) .\\nMore recently, we substituted the Tn5 transposase for MNase in a modified CUT&amp;RUN protocol, such that addition of Mg ++ results in a cut-and-paste \"tagmentation\" reaction, in which sequencing adapters are integrated around sites of antibody binding (Kaya-Okur et al., 2019) . In CUT&amp;Tag, DNA purification is followed by PCR amplification, eliminating the end-polishing and ligation steps required for sequencing library preparation in CUT&amp;RUN. Like CUT&amp;RUN, CUT&amp;Tag requires relatively little input material, and the low backgrounds permit low sequencing depths to sensitively map chromatin features. Because integrated pA-Tn5 is not released following the tagmentation reaction, CUT&amp;Tag and related methods are suitable for single-cell profiling, in which all steps through tagmentation are performed in a single in situ reaction, after which single cells or nuclei are dispensed for barcoding PCR amplification.\\nThe major practical advantage of CUT&amp;Tag over other methods is that it eliminates the time and expense of preparing sequencing libraries, but CUT&amp;Tag also has other important advantages that may make it the protocol of choice for most chromatin profiling applications. CUT&amp;Tag has improved signal-to-noise for histone marks, at least in part because an antibody-tethered Tn5 integrates its mosaic-end adapters and remains bound during the incubation (Kaya-Okur et al., 2019) . We also found that CUT&amp;Tag is somewhat more efficient than CUT&amp;RUN, likely because integration by targeted Tn5 is more efficient than enzymatic end-polishing and ligation in traditional library preparation steps.\\nHere we describe an at-home version of CUT&amp;Tag in which all steps from mixing of native or lightly cross-linked nuclei with magnetic beads to post-PCR purification are performed in a single tube. This simplification of CUT&amp;Tag requires only pipettors, a mini-centrifuge, a tube rotator, a PCR machine and disposable pipette tips, tubes and reagents to produce high-quality genome chromatin profiling data. During the COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions in Seattle we performed CUT&amp;Tag@home for 16-32 samples per day with uniformly high quality for chromatin marks of active regulatory elements, gene bodies, Polycomb-silenced regions and constitutive heterochromatin. The low cell number requirements and read depths of CUT&amp;Tag@home enable home-bound researchers to produce ready-for-sequencing barcoded libraries with relatively little technical expertise, effort or cost.\\nThe basic CUT&amp;Tag method is schematized in Figure 1 . Our simplified protocol applies to any chromatin feature for which an antibody is available and should be adaptable to any cell type for which there is a standard nuclei isolation protocol. In brief, native or lightly cross-linked nuclei are prepared and immobilized on magnetic beads. Beads are incubated with a primary antibody followed by incubation with a secondary antibody to increase the number of IgG molecules at each epitope bound by the primary antibody. Beads are washed and incubated with protein A-Tn5 loaded with mosaic-end adapters and washed under stringent conditions. Tn5 is activated by addition of Mg 2+ , a \"one-and-done\" reaction in that the pA-Tn5 transposome is not active once it integrates its adapters. DNA is released in a small volume of SDS and then mixed with Triton-X100 to neutralize the SDS. Samples are enriched by PCR amplification and a single Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) magnetic bead cleanup step. Up to 48 barcoded libraries from multiple experiments may be pooled for each lane of a 2-lane flow cell, as 3 million mapped paired-end reads are usually sufficient for a genome-wide profile of a histone modification in human cells. CUT&amp;Tag@home is performed on frozen nuclei using non-toxic materials, and has minimal equipment requirements, so that it can be conveniently performed in a utility area on ~1.5 meters of counter space (Figure 2) .\\nThe CUT&amp;Tag@home protocol is also available from Protocols.io (https://www.protocols.io/view/cut-amptag-home-bd26i8he), where users can Added antibody (green) binds to the target chromatin protein (blue) between nucleosomes (gray ovals) in the genome, and the excess is washed away. A second antibody (orange) is added and enhances tethering of pA-Tn5 transposome (gray boxes) at antibody-bound sites. After washing away excess transposome, addition of Mg++ activates the transposome and integrates adapters (red) at chromatin protein binding sites. Genomic fragments with adapters at both ends are released and enriched by PCR. b) CUT&amp;Tag is performed on a solid support. Unfixed cells or nuclei (blue) are permeabilized and mixed with antibody to a target chromatin protein. After addition and binding of cells to Concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads (M), all further steps are performed in the same reaction tube with magnetic capture between washes and incubations, including pA-Tn5 tethering, integration, and DNA purification.

Tip: To evaluate success of the procedure without requiring library preparation, include in parallel a positive control antibody (e.g.α-H3K27me3), and an optional negative control by omitting the primary antibody.\\n• Place tubes on the magnet stand to clear. Withdraw the liquid with the pipettor set to 5 µL less than the volume to be removed. • Mix the secondary antibody 1:100 in Wash buffer and squirt in 50 µL per sample while gently vortexing to allow the solution to dislodge the beads from the sides. Tip: Although not needed for CUT&amp;RUN, the secondary antibody step is required for CUT&amp;Tag to increase the number of Protein A binding sites for each bound antibody. We have found that without the secondary antibody the efficiency is very low. • Place the tubes on a Rotator and rotate at room temperature for 30 min.\\n• After a quick spin (&lt;500 x g), place the tubes on a magnet stand to clear and withdraw the liquid with the pipettor set to 5 µL less than the volume to be removed. • After a quick spin, replace on the magnet stand and withdraw the last drop with a 20 µL pipette tip. • With the tubes still on the magnet stand, carefully add 500 µL Wash buffer. The surface tension will cause the beads to slide up along the side of the tube closest to the magnet. • Slowly withdraw the liquid with a 1 mL pipette tip without disturbing the beads.\\nTip: To withdraw the liquid, set the pipettor to 600 µL, and keep the plunger depressed while lowering the tip to the bottom. The liquid level will rise to near the top completing the wash. Then ease off on the plunger until all the liquid is withdrawn, and remove the pipettor. This will leave behind at most a small drop of liquid. • After a quick spin, place the tubes on a magnet stand to remove the last drop with a 20 µL pipettor and proceed immediately to the next section.\\n• Mix pA-Tn5 adapter complex in 300-wash buffer to a final concentration of 1:200.

Tip: When using the recommended Macsimag magnet stand, dislodging the beads can be done by removing the plexiglass tube holder from the magnet, and with fingers on top to prevent the tubes from opening up or falling out, invert by rotating sharply a few times. • After a quick spin (&lt;500 x g), place the tubes on a Rotator at room temperature for 1 hr.\\n.

Tip: Twirling the tube back and forth rapidly between thumb and finger will effectively wet the sides of the tube, followed by a quick spin to bring most of the beads to the bottom. • Incubate at 58 ºC for 1 hr in a PCR cycler with heated lid to reverse the crosslinks and release pA-Tn5 from the tagmented DNA.\\n• To the PCR tube containing the bead slurry add 15 µL 0.67% Triton neutralization solution + 2 µL of 10 µM Universal or barcoded i5 primer + 2 µL of 10 µM uniquely barcoded i7 primers, using a different barcode for each sample. Vortex on full and place tubes in metal tube holder on ice. Tip: Indexed primers are described by Buenrostro, J.D. et al.

Tip: The cycle times are based on using a conventional Peltier cycler (e.g., BioRad/MJ PTC200), in which the ramping times (3°C/sec) are sufficient for annealing to occur as the sample cools from 98°C to 60°C. Therefore, the use of a rapid cycler with a higher ramping rate will require either reducing the ramping time or other adjustments to assure annealing.\\nTip: Do not add extra PCR cycles to see a signal by capillary gel electrophoresis (e.g. Tapestation). If there is no nucleosomal ladder for the H3K27me3 positive control, you may assume that CUT&amp;Tag failed, but observing no signal for a sparse chromatin protein such as a transcription factor is normal, and the barcoded sample can be concentrated for mixing with the pool of barcoded samples for sequencing. Extra PCR cycles reduce the complexity of the library and may result in an unacceptable level of PCR duplicates.\\n• After tubes have cooled, remove from the cycler and add 1.3 volume (65 µL) SPRI bead slurry, mixing by pipetting up and down. • Quick spin and let sit at room temperature 5-10 min.\\n• Place on magnet 5 min to allow the beads to clear before withdrawing the liquid.\\nWhile still on the magnet stand add 200 µL 80% ethanol. • Withdraw the liquid with a pipette to the bottom of the tube, and add 200 µL 80% ethanol. • Withdraw the liquid and after a quick spin, remove the remaining liquid with a 20 µL pipette. Do not air-dry the beads, but proceed immediately to the next step. • Remove from the magnet stand, add 22 µL 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and vortex on full.

For maximum economy, paired-end PE25 is more than sufficient for mapping to large genomes. • Using paired-end 25x25 sequencing on a HiSeq 2-lane rapid run flow cell we obtain ~300 million total mapped reads, or ~3 million per sample when there are 96 samples mixed to obtain approximately equal molarity.\\n• We align paired-end reads to hg19 using Bowtie2 version 2.3.4.3 with options: -end-to-end --very-sensitive --no-unal --no-mixed --no-discordant --phred33 -I 10 -X 700. For mapping E. coli carry-over fragments, we also use the --no-overlap -no-dovetail options to avoid possible cross-mapping of the experimental genome to that of the carry-over E. coli DNA that is used for calibration. • Tracks are made as bedgraph files of normalized counts, which are the fraction of total counts at each basepair scaled by the size of the hg19 genome. • To calibrate samples in a series for samples done in parallel using the same antibody we use counts of E. coli fragments carried over with the pA-Tn5 the same as one would for an ordinary spike-in. Our sample script (https://github.com/Henikoff/Cut-and-Run/blob/master/spike_in_calibration.csh) can be used to calibrate based on either a spike-in or E. coli carry-over DNA. • Most data analysis tools used for ChIP-seq data, such as bedtools (https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Picard (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and deepTools (https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/), can be used on CUT&amp;Tag data. • Analysis tools designed specifically for CUT&amp;RUN/Tag data include the SEACR peak caller (Meers et al., 2019) also available as a public web server (https://seacr.fredhutch.org), CUT&amp;RUNTools (Zhu et al., 2019) and henipipe (https://github.com/scfurl/henipipe).\\nWe have developed a streamlined version of CUT&amp;Tag that eliminates DNA extraction, so that all steps can be performed in a single PCR tube (Kaya-Okur et al., 2020) . CUT&amp;Tag@home uses the same protocol, which allowed for a direct comparison of inlab to at-home implementation. To ascertain the ability of this CUT&amp;Tag direct-to-PCR protocol to produce DNA sequencing libraries in our home laundry/utility room, we used frozen aliquots of native human K562 cell nuclei prepared in the laboratory and profiled there using the streamlined single-tube protocol. Aliquots of nuclei were thawed and serially diluted in Wash buffer from ~60,000 down to ~60 starting cells, where the average yield of nuclei was ~50%. We used antibodies to H3K27me3, which marks nucleosomes within broad domains of Polycomb-dependent silencing, and H3K4me3, which preferentially marks nucleosomes immediately downstream of active promoters. Aliquots of nuclei were taken home and stored in our kitchen freezer, then thawed and diluted at home, and profiled for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. In both the laboratory and at home we performed all steps in groups of 16 or 32 samples over the course of a single day, treating all samples the same regardless of cell numbers.

A total of 160 CUT&amp;Tag@home libraries were sequenced by the Fred Hutch Genomics Shared Resource on three two-lane PE25 Illumina flow-cells runs for an estimated cost of ~$50 per sample for materials and sequencing.\\nExamples of Tapestation profiles of libraries produced at home detects nucleosomal ladders down to 200 cells for H3K27me3 and nucleosomeal and subnucleosomal fragments for H3K4me3 (Fig.  4) . Sequenced fragments were aligned to the human genome using bowtie2 and tracks were displayed using IGV. Similar results were obtained for both athome and in-lab profiles for both histone modifications (Fig. 5) using pA-Tn5 produced in the laboratory, and results using a commercial Protein A/G-Tn5 were at least as good. However, the results for 60 starting cells were sparser than our published results for H3K27me3 using permeabilized cells with Proteinase K digestion and SPRI bead extraction of tagmented DNA. The lower yields using the singletube nuclei protocol could be due to losses during the nuclei preparation and/or reduction in efficiency during PCR in situ or other differences between the protocols.\\nTo illustrate the utility of our simple chromatin profiling approach, we chose antibodies to one dimethylated and four tri-methylated lysines on the Nterminal tail of Histone H3 that mark distinct chromatin features genome-wide. H3K4me3 preferentially marks nucleosomes immediately downstream of gene promoters and H3K4me2 also marks enhancers, H3K36me3 marks gene bodies, H3K27me3 marks regions of Polycomb developmental silencing (facultative heterochromatin) and H3K9me3 marks regions of constitutive heterochromatin. A representative region is shown (Figure 6) , with selected comparisons to illustrate specific chromatin features. A comparison between H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 shows the active housekeeping STRIP2 promoter marked by H3K4me3 and an enhancer just downstream marked by both modifications. These functional inferences are supported by an ATACseq track, which shows that both sites are accessible to Tn5 and by SuRE (Survey of Regulatory Elements), a massively parallel reporter survey for autonomous active regulatory elements in K562 cells (van Arensbergen et al., 2017) . Further downstream the STRIP2 gene body is heavily marked by H3K36me3, in contrast to the NRF1 gene The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.043083 doi: bioRxiv preprint encoding a transcription factor, where there is strong H3K4 di-and tri-methylation, but very little gene-body H3K36me3. This example illustrates the rich gene regulatory information that can be obtained by CUT&amp;Tag.\\nTo extend these observations to a genomic scale, we aligned the four H3 lysine trimethylation datasets to transcriptional start sites and produced heatmaps ordered by signal intensity over ±10 kb intervals. As expected, the H3K4me3 peak lies just downstream of the promoter, showing very little overlap with H3K36me3, confirmed by average plots of these marks normalized to the genome (Fig. 7a) .\\nA comparison between H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 CUT&amp;Tag tracks suggests that these two silencing marks are non-overlapping (Fig. 6) . Interestingly, in the highlighted example, a strong peak of H3K9me3 is seen to correspond to an ERV-1 family Figure 3 were sequenced and tracks for a representative region were compared to an ENCODE dataset (GSM788088), to datasets produced using the original extraction protocol, and this single-tube protocol performed in the lab. Asterisks indicate CUT&amp;Tag@home datasets produced using a commercial pAG-Tn5 preparation (Epicypher cat. no. 15-1017) . b) Same as (a) for H3K4me3 comparing results from CUT&amp;Tag@home to those produced using the single-tube protocol in the lab and an ENCODE dataset (GSM733680). Tracks are autoscaled for clarity, except for the IgG negative control tracks, which were scaled the same as that for the 60-cell CUT&amp;Tag@home sample.

To ascertain the generality of the observation, we extracted 20-kb segments centered over the middle of each ERV from the H3 lysine trimethylation tracks over Chromosome 1, which harbors 50,707 of the 695,067 human ERVs, from the UCSC Repeat Masker file. We stacked the segments ordered by decreasing length of the ERV (Fig. 7b) . For H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 we observed essentially no signal over these elements, whereas for H3K9me3 we observed signal over elements of all sizes, including a cluster of heavily H3K9me3-marked ERV fragments spanning ~2 kb in length. This observation is consistent with studies showing that intact and active ERVs are among the most heavily H3K9me3-methylated elements in mammalian genomes (Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014; Ohtani et al., 2018; Walter et al., 2016) . To determine whether there are any differences among the ERV families in the propensity for gaining H3K9 trimethylation, we performed unsupervised k-means clustering over a ±1 kb span on the full set of Chromosome 1 ERVs (k=3). Cluster I comprises 5,536 heavily H3K9trimethylated ERVs (11%) and Cluster III comprises 31,177 ERVs (62%) with background levels of H3K9 trimethylation (Fig 7b, rightmost panel) . Among the ERV families, ERVK, which accounts for 8% of the total human ERVs, was on average 2.8-fold more highly represented in Cluster I relative to Cluster III (186:382) than were all other ERVs (5350:30795). The ERVK family is the youngest and most intact of the human endogenous retrovirus families (Hanke et al., 2016) , and in the mouse male germline, members of the ERVK family were specifically reactivated upon loss of a germline- Figure 6 : CUT&amp;Tag@home segments the human epigenome with four H3 lysine trimethylation marks: Screenshot of a representative 1 Mb region of the human genome showing CUT&amp;Tag@home profiles for histone H3 lysine-4 methylation of constitutive heterochromatin (K9me3), Polycomb-dependent silenced domains (K27me3) transcribed gene bodies (K36me3), promoters (K4me3), promoters and enhancers (K4me2) and accessible DNA (ATAC-seq, GSM269550). Two regions are expanded to illustrate the predominantly mutual exclusivity of the tri-methylation marks, also showing two SuRE autonomous regulatory elements annotated as an enhancer (above) and promoter (below). An ERV-1 retrotransposon is heavily marked by H3K9me3.

Thus the enrichment of ERVK in the heavily H3K9-trimethylated class is consistent with a role for this modification in maintaining genome integrity by suppression of endogenous retroviral proliferation.\\nWe conclude that five CUT&amp;Tag@home histone H3 methylation profiles segment the human genome at high-resolution into active promoters, enhancers, gene bodies, developmentally silenced domains and constitutively silenced endogenous retroviruses. Whereas chromatin accessibility profiling maps only enhancers and promoters without distinguishing between them (e.g. the ATAC-seq track in Figure 5 ), CUT&amp;Tag using histone methylation antibodies captures the extraordinary richness of the full epigenome.\\nWe previously introduced CUT&amp;Tag for efficient low-cost genome-wide chromatin profiling and showed that it provides high-resolution profiles for epitopes on nucleosomes, transcription factors and RNA Polymerase II with especially low signal-to-noise Fig. 7 : H3 lysine trimethylation data aligned to TSSs and ERVs. a) Heatmaps ordered by normalized counts (the scaled fraction of total counts at each basepair) and average plots showing that these four H3 tail trimethylations are mostly non-overlapping genome-wide when aligned around transcriptional start sites (TSSs). b) Heatmaps of the four H3 tail trimethylations aligned around the midpoints of the 50,707 annotated ERV elements on human Chromosome 1 and ordered top-to-bottom by decreasing element size. For clarity, the top segment of the H3K9me3 panel is expanded in the panel to the right to reveal a cluster of ~2-kb elements. K-means clustering of the 2-kb region centered around the midpoints all Chromosome 1 ERV elements separated the ERVs into a heavily H3K9trimethylated Cluster I (11%), a weakly H3K9-trimethylated Cluster II (27%) and Cluster III with background levels of H3K9 trimethylation (62%).

We showed that CUT&amp;Tag is highly versatile not only in the range of chromatin features it can profile, but also in the read-out platforms it is suitable for, including in plate format for low-cell-number samples and nanowell dispensing for on the order of 1000 single cells. Since our original CUT&amp;Tag publication in April, 2019, we have distributed &gt;600 pA-Tn5 aliquots to laboratories around the world, and during that time our original protocol has been the most popular of the ~6000 protocols on Protocols.io (Lenny Teytelman, personal communication). Because CUT&amp;Tag requires that cells or nuclei remain intact throughout the procedure, there are no harsh treatments or toxic chemicals required, which makes the protocol inherently safe and appropriate for being performed in a home utility area. Therefore, we expect that CUT&amp;Tag@home will be welcomed by a substantial cohort of users, whether they are able to work in the lab or can only work at home subject to COVID-19 restrictions.\\nCUT&amp;Tag@home implements a streamlined version of the bench-top protocol that allows for chromatin profiling without tube transfers from nuclei to purified sequencing-ready barcoded libraries (Kaya-Okur et al., 2020) . Elimination of the DNA purification steps of CUT&amp;Tag allows all operations from mixing of nuclei with magnetic beads to final library purification to be performed entirely by successive treatments of bead-bound nuclei in a single PCR tube. This protocol can be performed on as many as 32 samples in a single day with starting cell numbers ranging from &lt;100 to ~100,000. We have extended the versatility of this streamlined CUT&amp;Tag protocol by demonstrating that it can be performed with minor equipment, reagent and supply needs using materials borrowed from the lab or purchased online and delivered. This enables researchers, students and others with little hands-on laboratory experience to perform chromatin profiling at home. Although we do not expect that quantification, quality control and pooling of barcoded samples and sequencing to be also done at home, these services are likely to be available at many commercial and academic facilities, even during the COVID-19 crisis. In the longer term, we expect that the simplicity of our CUT&amp;Tag@home protocol makes it just as suitable for the lab bench as it is for the laundry room.\\nEpicypher 13-0027; H3K4me3: Active Motif 39159; H3K36me3: Thermo MAS-24687 and Epicypher 13-0031; H3K9me3: Abcam ab8898; H3K27me3: CST #9733; Guinea pig antirabbit secondary: Antibodies Online AbIN101961.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>all dynamic processes that take place on dna in the nucleus occur in the context of a chromatin landscape that comprises nucleosomes and their modifications , transcription factors and chromatin-associated complexes . a variety of chromatin features mark sites of transcriptional regulatory elements and regions of activation and silencing that differ between cell types and change during development and disease progression . the mapping of chromatin features genome-wide has traditionally been performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) , in which chromatin is cross-linked and solubilized and an antibody to a protein or modification of interest is used to immunoprecipitate the bound dna ( rodriguez-ubreva and ballestar , 2014 ) . however , alternative chromatin profiling methods based on enzyme tethering in situ have recently gained in popularity . for example , in cleavage under targets &amp; release using nuclease ( cut &amp; run ) ( skene and henikoff , 2017 ) , which is based on laemmli 's chromatin immunocleavage ( chic ) method ( schmid et al. , 2004 ) , a fusion protein between micrococcal nuclease ( mnase ) and protein a binds sites of antibody binding in nuclei or permeabilized cells bound to magnetic beads . activation of mnase with ca ++ results in targeted cleavage releasing the antibody-bound fragment into the supernatant for paired-end dna sequencing . the low backgrounds resulting from antibody-tethered cleavage and release reduce cell numbers and sequencing depths required to map chromatin features relative to chip-seq , and cut &amp; run is now becoming a standard tool for mapping transcription factors and other chromatin features ( hainer et al. , 2019 ; liu et al. , 2018 ; oomen et al. , 2019 ; roth et al. , 2018 ) . more recently , we substituted the tn5 transposase for mnase in a modified cut &amp; run protocol , such that addition of mg ++ results in a cut-and-paste `` tagmentation '' reaction , in which sequencing adapters are integrated around sites of antibody binding ( kaya-okur et al. , 2019 ) . in cut &amp; tag , dna purification is followed by pcr amplification , eliminating the end-polishing and ligation steps required for sequencing library preparation in cut &amp; run . like cut &amp; run , cut &amp; tag requires relatively little input material , and the low backgrounds permit low sequencing depths to sensitively map chromatin features . because integrated pa-tn5 is not released following the tagmentation reaction , cut &amp; tag and related methods are suitable for single-cell profiling , in which all steps through tagmentation are performed in a single in situ reaction , after which single cells or nuclei are dispensed for barcoding pcr amplification . the major practical advantage of cut &amp; tag over other methods is that it eliminates the time and expense of preparing sequencing libraries , but cut &amp; tag also has other important advantages that may make it the protocol of choice for most chromatin profiling applications . cut &amp; tag has improved signal-to-noise for histone marks , at least in part because an antibody-tethered tn5 integrates its mosaic-end adapters and remains bound during the incubation ( kaya-okur et al. , 2019 ) . we also found that cut &amp; tag is somewhat more efficient than cut &amp; run , likely because integration by targeted tn5 is more efficient than enzymatic end-polishing and ligation in traditional library preparation steps . here we describe an at-home version of cut &amp; tag in which all steps from mixing of native or lightly cross-linked nuclei with magnetic beads to post-pcr purification are performed in a single tube . this simplification of cut &amp; tag requires only pipettors , a mini-centrifuge , a tube rotator , a pcr machine and disposable pipette tips , tubes and reagents to produce high-quality genome chromatin profiling data . during the covid-19 physical distancing restrictions in seattle we performed cut &amp; tag @ home for 16-32 samples per day with uniformly high quality for chromatin marks of active regulatory elements , gene bodies , polycomb-silenced regions and constitutive heterochromatin . the low cell number requirements and read depths of cut &amp; tag @ home enable home-bound researchers to produce ready-for-sequencing barcoded libraries with relatively little technical expertise , effort or cost . the basic cut &amp; tag method is schematized in figure 1 . our simplified protocol applies to any chromatin feature for which an antibody is available and should be adaptable to any cell type for which there is a standard nuclei isolation protocol . in brief , native or lightly cross-linked nuclei are prepared and immobilized on magnetic beads . beads are incubated with a primary antibody followed by incubation with a secondary antibody to increase the number of igg molecules at each epitope bound by the primary antibody . beads are washed and incubated with protein a-tn5 loaded with mosaic-end adapters and washed under stringent conditions . tn5 is activated by addition of mg 2+ , a `` one-and-done '' reaction in that the pa-tn5 transposome is not active once it integrates its adapters . dna is released in a small volume of sds and then mixed with triton-x100 to neutralize the sds . samples are enriched by pcr amplification and a single solid phase reversible immobilization ( spri ) magnetic bead cleanup step . up to 48 barcoded libraries from multiple experiments may be pooled for each lane of a 2-lane flow cell , as 3 million mapped paired-end reads are usually sufficient for a genome-wide profile of a histone modification in human cells . cut &amp; tag @ home is performed on frozen nuclei using non-toxic materials , and has minimal equipment requirements , so that it can be conveniently performed in a utility area on ~1.5 meters of counter space ( figure 2 ) . the cut &amp; tag @ home protocol is also available from protocols.io ( https : //www.protocols.io/view/cut-amptag-home-bd26i8he ) , where users can added antibody ( green ) binds to the target chromatin protein ( blue ) between nucleosomes ( gray ovals ) in the genome , and the excess is washed away . a second antibody ( orange ) is added and enhances tethering of pa-tn5 transposome ( gray boxes ) at antibody-bound sites . after washing away excess transposome , addition of mg++ activates the transposome and integrates adapters ( red ) at chromatin protein binding sites . genomic fragments with adapters at both ends are released and enriched by pcr . b ) cut &amp; tag is performed on a solid support . unfixed cells or nuclei ( blue ) are permeabilized and mixed with antibody to a target chromatin protein . after addition and binding of cells to concanavalin a-coated magnetic beads ( m ) , all further steps are performed in the same reaction tube with magnetic capture between washes and incubations , including pa-tn5 tethering , integration , and dna purification . from ( kaya-okur et al. , 2019 ) . . cc-by 4.0 international license author/funder . it is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint ( which was not peer-reviewed ) is the . https : //doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.043083 doi : biorxiv preprint ask questions , comment and provide feedback . we intend to update this document with each update on protocols.io . • chilling device ( e.g . metal heat blocks on ice or cold packs in an ice cooler ) • pipettors ( e.g . rainin classic pipette 1 ml , 200 µl , 20 µl , 10 µl ) • disposable tips ( e.g . rainin 1 ml , 200 µl , 20 µl ) • disposable centrifuge tubes for reagents ( 15 ml or 50 ml ) • standard 1.5 ml microfuge tubes • 0.5 ml maximum recovery pcr tubes ( e.g . fisher cat . no . 14-222-294 ) • frozen nuclei suspension ( human k562 cells ) prepared as described in : https : //www.protocols.io/view/bench-top-cut-amp-tag-bcuhiwt6 . • concanavalin a ( cona ) -coated magnetic beads ( bangs labs , cat . no . bp531 ) • strong magnet stand ( e.g . miltenyi macsimag separator , cat . no . 130-092-168 ) figure 2 : equipment , supplies , reagents and solutions for cut &amp;

ohtani et al. , 2018 ; walter et al. , 2016 ) . to determine whether there are any differences among the erv families in the propensity for gaining h3k9 trimethylation , we performed unsupervised k-means clustering over a ±1 kb span on the full set of chromosome 1 ervs ( k=3 ) . cluster i comprises 5,536 heavily h3k9trimethylated ervs ( 11 % ) and cluster iii comprises 31,177 ervs ( 62 % ) with background levels of h3k9 trimethylation ( fig 7b , rightmost panel ) . among the erv families , ervk , which accounts for 8 % of the total human ervs , was on average 2.8-fold more highly represented in cluster i relative to cluster iii ( 186:382 ) than were all other ervs ( 5350:30795 ) . the ervk family is the youngest and most intact of the human endogenous retrovirus families ( hanke et al. , 2016 ) , and in the mouse male germline , members of the ervk family were specifically reactivated upon loss of a germline- figure 6 : cut &amp;

The duration of scholarly journals' publication process is one of the main factors hindering quick delivery of new information. While proper editorial assessment and peer review obviously require some time, turnaround times for medical journals can be up to several months, which is undesirable in the era of a crisis. Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals' publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review.\", 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]</td>\n",
       "      <td>The world is facing an unprecedented health crisis affecting nearly all parts of society. In these times, access to the most state-of-the-art scientific knowledge is paramount to tackling the crisis. Academic journals and scholarly publishers are hence called upon to make new knowledge openly available and deliver new insights quickly.\\nIn the current Covid-19 era, it is clear that new knowledge is direly needed. Scientists all over the world have stepped in to do experiments, observational studies and new analyses as to obtain relevant information. However fast we would like to have access to this information, the scientific method used to obtain it, requires time. Drug trials and vaccine creations do not happen overnight (Thorp, 2020) . However, once such information has been gathered, it needs to be disseminated to all those potentially in the position to use it, as quick as possible. Traditionally, scholarly journals have been one of the main outlets to facilitate this (Horbach &amp; Halffman, 2018) .\\nOne of the factors hindering quick delivery of new information through scholarly journals is the duration of their publication process. Through editorial assessment and peer review, journals select which articles deserve to be published on their pages, ideally filtering out invalid, erroneous or otherwise problematic research. Even though celebrated as being one of the hallmarks of science, the editorial process is also regularly criticized. Commentators blame it for being inconsistent (Peters &amp; Ceci, 1982) , essentially flawed (Smith, 2006) , biased (Teplitskiy, Acuna, Elamrani-Raoult, Körding, &amp; Evans, 2018) , andparticularly relevant in these times of crisis -slow (Nguyen et al., 2015) .\\nSeveral studies have previously aimed to assess the typical duration of journals' publication process (Lin, Hou, &amp; Wu, 2016; Tosi, 2009 ). In their analyses, researchers commonly distinguish two stages of this process: the review stage (i.e. the stage between article submission and formal acceptance) and the editorial stage (i.e. the stage between acceptance and final publication, either online or in print). In a meta-analysis including over 2700 journal articles, Björk and Solomon (2013) find considerable differences in turnaround times (i.e. the period between submission and publication of a journal article, sometimes also called 'publication delays') between research disciplines. For biomedical journals, they find an average duration of the review stage of just over four months, while the editorial stage takes on average about five months. Clearly, such turnaround times are highly undesirable in light of the current health crisis.\\nTwo major responses to circumvent long turnaround times can currently be witnessed. From an author perspective, commentators are reporting a sharp increase in the use of preprint servers. On these online platforms, authors upload their manuscript, making it publicly accessible immediately upon finalization of the text (Gunnarsdottir, 2005) . Because no review, editorial assessment or copyediting takes place, manuscripts can be made accessible without publication delay. However, as manuscripts are only reviewed once they are available for anybody to read and use, scholars warn for potentially incorrect results spreading without editorial assessment filtering them. In fact, several cases of invalid research regarding Covid-19 being published as preprints have already been reported (Heimstädt, 2020; Marcus &amp; Oransky, 2020) . It should be noted though that this is not specific to preprints, as journal articles can require from post-publication corrections and retractions as well (Horbach &amp; Halffman, 2019) . Several articles related to Covid-19 have already gone through this process (Gautret et al., 2020) .\\nFrom the publishers' side, several journals and publishers are currently modifying their editorial procedures and policies to warrant fast dissemination of relevant information. For instance, eLife announced it would curtail requests for additional experiments during revisions, suspend its deadline for submitting revisions, make the posting of preprints to bioRxiv or medRxiv the default for all eLife submissions, and it would specifically mobilize early-career researchers to become reviewing editors and reviewers in order to extent the journal's reviewer pool (Eisen, Akhmanova, Behrens, &amp; Weigel, 2020) . Similarly, Nature put out an open invitation to researchers with relevant expertise to review Covid-19 related papers over short time (\"Coronavirus pandemic: Nature's pledge to you,\" 2020). Hence, journals and publishers are aiming to attract reviewers that can assist in the rapid publication of new findings, relevant to tackle the health crisis. The Medical Journal of Australia (MJA) has drafted policies related to both preprints are rapid peer review, setting up 'fast lanes' for Covid-19 related research:\\n\"The MJA has stepped up to play its part in meeting this crisis, including ultra-rapid review of SARS-CoV-2 manuscripts and pre-print publication of unedited papers, to ensure that the newest data and viewpoints are available as soon as possible.\" (Talley, 2020) The Royal Society Open Publishing announced to establish a similar fast lane for their registered reports on Covid-19 related content. They have even gathered a group of 700 reviewers who have committed to review a paper in 24 to 48 hours when called up on (Brock, 2020) . The journal also acknowledges one of the major concerns related to these fast dissemination models: \"The ultra-rapid review and publication model entails a risk of error, but sharing important information too slowly is a much greater hazard.\" (Talley, 2020) In this article, we assess whether the scholarly publishing community succeeds in speeding up the dissemination of Covid-19 related content. To do so, we assess the use of preprint servers, the uptake of preprint articles in academic journals, and the duration of journals' publication process both prior to and during the present pandemic.\\nFor our analysis, we use a repository of Covid-19 related research articles established by the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS). The repository is based on databases of CORD19, Dimensions and the World Health Organisation (WHO), and includes articles on Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related (corona) viruses and infectious diseases. In particular, this means that the database contains journal articles and preprints that predate the current Covid-19 pandemic, as it for instance also includes articles on the 2002 SARS virus and disease. For brevity's sake, all such articles will in the remainder of this article by described as 'Covid-19 related' articles. A full description of the database as well as access to all relevant data is available (CWTS, 2020). Colavizza et al. (2020) provide a description and analysis of parts of this database. All results in this article are based on the April 4 release of the database. We note that the majority of articles in the dataset originates from the CORD19 database. Some doubt has been raised about the relevance of some of this database's articles to the current pandemic (Colavizza et al., 2020) , but for our purposes, the scope of the database seems reasonable. Based on this dataset, several analyses were performed:\\nWe analysed the duration of the publication process, in number of days, for a sample of 529 journal articles. 259 articles were published during the present pandemic (i.e. from Jan 1, 2020) and 270 were published prior to the pandemic (i.e. before Oct 1, 2019). The articles were published in 14 different journals. Journals were selected based on their number of articles both prior to and during the current pandemic as well as the availability of data on when articles were submitted, accepted and published. We selected the ten journals publishing most Covid-19 related articles in general, supplemented by the five journals publishing most Covid-19 related content since the start of the pandemic, that make publication data (submission, acceptance and publish) available. One journal, Viruses, matches both criteria. The list of journals used in this analysis, including their number of articles, as well as the journals discarded because no data on submission, acceptance or publication dates was available, is added as supplementary material A. From those journals, we sampled all articles published since the start of the pandemic and matched those to an equal number of articles published in the same journal prior to the pandemic to form a control group. In case the control group had fewer articles, we used this number of articles and only selected the most recent articles after the pandemic. In case less than ten articles were published since the start of the pandemic, we nonetheless sampled ten articles for the control group. For the control group, we sampled articles starting with publications in 2019 (but before Oct 1 st ) and moving backwards, in order to make sure editorial policies most closely resemble those in the pandemic. Table 1 presents the list of journals used, including the number of articles sampled per journal. Information on the dates of submission, acceptance and publication was manually retrieved from the journal's webpage. In case journals distinguished between publication online and appearance in the print issue of the journal, we selected the date of online publication.\\nTo control for potential effects specific to Covid-19 related papers, we selected, for all journals in our sample, the ten most recently published articles (as of April 16 th , 2020) about non-Covid-19 related content. In particular, these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning Covid-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or Cov-19 in their title, keywords and abstract. All the 140 articles in this control group were published during the current pandemic, with 64% published in April 2020, 32% in March, 1% in February, and 3% in January.\\nWe assessed the usage of preprint servers as a fast way of disseminating academic knowledge by counting the number of preprints on Covid-19 related content both during and before the current pandemic. For this we used all preprints in de database, and did use a more narrow sampling strategy. Hence, we include all Covid-19 related preprints. In addition, we analysed the number of preprints that also appeared as journal articles, and the average number of days between publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article. The analysis is based on the linkage of preprints and journal articles in the Dimensions Database (https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/index.html). Figure 2 compares the overall duration of journals' publication process prior to and during the present pandemic. It demonstrates that, on average, journals have drastically increased the speed of their processes for Covid-19 publications: average turnaround times in our journal sample has decreased from 117 to 60 days. Comparing the 95% confidence intervals of both statistics, shows the decrease to be highly substantial and significant. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the average duration of the publication process for Covid-19 related articles in journals in our sample. It distinguishes between the periods before and during the pandemic and it splits the entire publication process in the Review stage (between submission and acceptance) and Editorial stage (between acceptance and submission). Figure 3 presents a graphical overview of the average decrease in turnaround time in the period during the crisis compared to the period prior to the pandemic. It again distinguishes between the Review and Editorial stages of the publication process. Note that negative numbers in this case indicate an increase in turnaround time. The figure indicates the Review stage shortens for ten out of the fourteen journals in our sample, while nine journals managed to shorten their Editorial stage. Average acceleration is around 50% for both stages, but it goes up to nearly 100% in some journals. To check whether the acceleration of publication processes is specific to Covid-19 related papers, we analysed the turnaround times for non-Covid-19 related articles published since the start of the pandemic. For all journals in our sample, we selected the ten most recently published articles (as of April 16 th , 2020) about non-Covid-19 related content. In particular, these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning Covid-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or Cov-19 in their title, keywords and abstract. For these articles we also analysed the turnaround times of their publication process. Results are presented in figure 4 . The figure indicates that for most journals, articles not related to Covid-19 have very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic. Unpacking the publication process in the Review and Editorial stage, we conclude that, again, non-Covid-19 related articles follow a very similar pattern to articles published before the pandemic. \\nSome of the most prominent, high impact medical journals are not part of our sample, because they do not share all relevant data on submission, acceptance and publication dates. Comparing the total number of published articles in high impact journals such as BMJ, The Lancet, JAMA and NEJM does not give a clear indication of faster publication: These four journals published 864, 421, 351, and 307 articles respectively in 2020, according to a Web of Science search. Over the same period in 2019 they published 874, 497, 335, and 334 articles respectively. Hence, most show a small decrease in the total number of published articles. Consequently, if they managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles, this has gone at the expense of other content being published less, or less quickly.\\nNext we turn our analysis towards the publication of preprints. As was shown in figure 1 , the number of preprints on Covid-19 related content has seen a sharp increase since the outbreak of the pandemic. In total 2102 preprints were published on seven preprint servers: SSRN Electronic Journal, bioRxiv, ChemRxiv, JMIR Preprints, Research Square, and medRxiv. We note that even though arXiv publications are included in the Dimensions database, they are not included in the 4 April release of the dataset we used, due to technical issues. Out of the 2102 preprints in our dataset, 129 have currently also appeared as journal article. Due to the small number of preprints appearing as journal articles, no statistically relevant conclusions can be drawn about the uptake of preprints in journals. However, analyse the average duration between the publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article we see a steady increase, ranging from, on average, 137 days in 2017 and just over 200 days in 2020. Currently, we do not see any indication of acceleration of the uptake of preprints in journals since the outbreak of \\nAll but one of these preprint-journal article pairs were published prior to the current pandemic. However, comparing the results in tables 1 and 2, it becomes clear that turnaround times for articles that previously appeared as preprints are much shorter than the average turnaround times in these journals. In fact, for these pre-pandemic articles, turnaround times are even shorter than their postpandemic counterparts.\\nOur analysis indicates that the scholarly publishing enterprise has managed to drastically speed up the dissemination of Covid-19 related research material since the outbreak of the pandemic. In particular, academic journals managed to decrease the duration of their publication process by 49%, or 57 days on average, which is a statistically relevant difference. Some journals even show a decrease in publication time of over 80% compared to the pre-crisis era. This acceleration concerns both the stage of review (between submission and acceptance) and the editing stage (between acceptance and publication). The journals in our sample shortened both stages by 47% (45 days) and 61% (14 days) respectively. Hence the majority of the decrease in total publication time is due to speeding up the review process. We also conclude that the acceleration of the publication process is specific to Covid-19 related articles.\\nArticles not related to Covid-19 published during the pandemic show very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic.\\nIn addition to a fast spread of information through journal articles, the number of papers submitted to preprint servers has drastically increased. However, such preprints do not seem to be taken up as journal publications any quicker than they were before the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, articles first appearing as preprints do seem to go through shorter publication processes than articles not appearing as preprints.\\nTo tackle the current health crisis, many have urged to disseminate relevant academic knowledge as fast as possible. Acknowledging that typical publication delays in medical journals are unacceptable in the current era, journals are expected to decrease the turnaround times of their publication process. The results of our study indicate that journals have indeed managed to do so.\\nOur results on the average turnaround times of journal articles prior to the current pandemic corresponds well with earlier findings of studies on publication delays in medical journals (Björk &amp; Solomon, 2013) . However, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, medical journals have managed to drastically accelerate their publication process to make it nearly twice as fast for Covid-19 related articles. On the contrary, articles not related to Covid-19 that were published since the beginning of the pandemic, do not show any acceleration. Their turnaround times are similar to articles published before the pandemic.\\nWhile it seems reasonable that journals might encounter difficulties to attract reviewers with relevant expertise -since those are probably active scientists working on novel research themselves -the contrary seems to be the case. Concluding from our results, it seems that journals are finding enough reviewers willing to review Covid-19 related papers on a very short notice. However, this conclusion should be treated with caution, as no data is available on who reviewed the papers. Maybe the same few experts reviewed a lot more than usual; maybe 'relevant expertise' was taken as a relative criterion, with journals using reviewers that usually would not have counted as experts. The fact that non-Covid-19 related papers are published at similar speeds during and before the pandemic, seems to indicate that journals are also not facing more issues with attracting reviewers for those papers.\\nAs preprint articles are not being included in medical journals more quickly, it seems that either authors are not submitting preprint articles to journals more quickly, or journals are prioritizing content that has not appeared as preprint. Qualitative follow-up research interviewing authors and editors on their submission and review practices regarding preprint articles could shed further light on this.\\nEven though the acceleration of journals' publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination, it also raises several questions and concerns.\\nFirst, one could wonder whether faster is always better. Even though the two do not necessarily exclude each other, it seems reasonable that there is a balance, or perhaps even a trade-off, between speed and quality in peer review. Especially concerning the stage of review, legitimate concerns can be raised on whether speeding up the review process might harm the process' ability to filter incorrect or invalid findings. Such research slipping through peer review, might require corrections or retractions in the future. Given the potentially rapid uptake of medical knowledge in policy and clinical contexts, such corrections might come in too late as potential harm might have already been done. Commentators have raised this concern regarding the usage of information in preprints, but it similarly applies to journal articles. In fact, false information spreading through journal articles is arguably more damaging, since it has the appearance of being 'peer reviewed' and hence properly verified. Scholars have repeatedly warned that a substantial share of articles (hastily) published during this crisis, will require future corrections (Marcus &amp; Oransky, 2020) . Formal expressions of concern -on papers used to make policy decisions -have already been issued (Voss, 2020) . Future research should therefore analyse whether shorter review processes during the Covid-19 pandemic have led to an increase in corrections or retractions of published articles.\\nWhile drastic acceleration of the review stage might evoke quality issues, this arguably applies less to the editorial stage of the publication process. Journals' achievement of shortening this stage of the publication process for Covid-19 related content is purely laudable. However, this might raise questions about why publication delays in this stage are usually higher and whether journals will aim and be able to maintain such standards in a post-crisis era. One potential explanation for the shortened editorial stage is that publishers or journal editors now prioritize Covid-19 related research articles, at the expense of other articles. However, our data on non-Covid-19 related articles published during the pandemic seems to contradict this. It seems like journals are managing to speed up editorial work for Covid-19 related content, while maintaining standards for other articles.\\nSeveral journals show a substantial lengthening of the editorial stage. This might be caused by an increase in the number of manuscripts submitted to the respective journals. For journals showing an increase in total turnaround time, this seems to be concentrated in the editorial process. Since editors themselves might be practicing scientists, the overload of newly submitted manuscripts might be a cause of this additional delay.\\nThis study potentially suffers from various limitations in its analysis. First, it could only analyse those journal articles that have been published. This particularly implies that it was unable to assess the review process' duration for rejected articles. Neither could it analyse articles that are currently still under review.\\nSecond, the analysis does not include article type as a feature of analysis. Some article types, including letters to the editor, perspectives or commentaries, might undergo a different kind of peer reviewthey might for instance only be reviewed by the editor, rather than by external reviewers. A potential difference in distribution of pre-and post-crisis articles over the various article types might explain some of the variation in the publication process' duration.\\nThird, our analyses focus on journals publishing relatively many Covid-19 related articles. Due to a lack of sufficient articles in other, potentially smaller journals, we were not able to analyse those journals. As larger journals may more easily attract reviewers and have more resources, and hence more capacity to shift resources, to execute the editorial stage of publication, the resulting decrease in publication time might be less strong in smaller journals. At a later stage, when more Covid-19 related papers appear in other journals, future research could verify this potential difference.\\nLast, it should be noted that some of the journal articles assigned to our control group concern papers related to previous health crises or pandemics such as the MESH, EBOLA or ZIKA crises. Despite similar incentives to publish those articles quickly, content related to Covid-19 makes its way through the publication process much quicker. Future research could include a more elaborate comparison not only between pre-and post-Covid-19 eras, but also between publishing in the Covid-19 and other health related crises.\\nIn these times of crisis, the rapid dissemination of relevant academic knowledge is of paramount importance. Several stakeholders have already warned for a 'fake-news pandemic' spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories through social media channels in the absence of established .

To assist policymakers and clinical experts, as well as to counter the spread of such disinformation, researchers and academic journals have a responsibility to share available knowledge quickly. The fact that medical journals have managed to considerably speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related content during the current pandemic is therefore laudable. However, some concerns remain about whether faster dissemination might go at the expense of research quality. Quickly spreading false information might do more harm than slowly spreading reliable knowledge.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>the world is facing an unprecedented health crisis affecting nearly all parts of society . in these times , access to the most state-of-the-art scientific knowledge is paramount to tackling the crisis . academic journals and scholarly publishers are hence called upon to make new knowledge openly available and deliver new insights quickly . in the current covid-19 era , it is clear that new knowledge is direly needed . scientists all over the world have stepped in to do experiments , observational studies and new analyses as to obtain relevant information . however fast we would like to have access to this information , the scientific method used to obtain it , requires time . drug trials and vaccine creations do not happen overnight ( thorp , 2020 ) . however , once such information has been gathered , it needs to be disseminated to all those potentially in the position to use it , as quick as possible . traditionally , scholarly journals have been one of the main outlets to facilitate this ( horbach &amp; halffman , 2018 ) . one of the factors hindering quick delivery of new information through scholarly journals is the duration of their publication process . through editorial assessment and peer review , journals select which articles deserve to be published on their pages , ideally filtering out invalid , erroneous or otherwise problematic research . even though celebrated as being one of the hallmarks of science , the editorial process is also regularly criticized . commentators blame it for being inconsistent ( peters &amp; ceci , 1982 ) , essentially flawed ( smith , 2006 ) , biased ( teplitskiy , acuna , elamrani-raoult , körding , &amp; evans , 2018 ) , andparticularly relevant in these times of crisis -slow ( nguyen et al. , 2015 ) . several studies have previously aimed to assess the typical duration of journals ' publication process ( lin , hou , &amp; wu , 2016 ; tosi , 2009 ) . in their analyses , researchers commonly distinguish two stages of this process : the review stage ( i.e . the stage between article submission and formal acceptance ) and the editorial stage ( i.e . the stage between acceptance and final publication , either online or in print ) . in a meta-analysis including over 2700 journal articles , björk and solomon ( 2013 ) find considerable differences in turnaround times ( i.e . the period between submission and publication of a journal article , sometimes also called 'publication delays ' ) between research disciplines . for biomedical journals , they find an average duration of the review stage of just over four months , while the editorial stage takes on average about five months . clearly , such turnaround times are highly undesirable in light of the current health crisis . two major responses to circumvent long turnaround times can currently be witnessed . from an author perspective , commentators are reporting a sharp increase in the use of preprint servers . on these online platforms , authors upload their manuscript , making it publicly accessible immediately upon finalization of the text ( gunnarsdottir , 2005 ) . because no review , editorial assessment or copyediting takes place , manuscripts can be made accessible without publication delay . however , as manuscripts are only reviewed once they are available for anybody to read and use , scholars warn for potentially incorrect results spreading without editorial assessment filtering them . in fact , several cases of invalid research regarding covid-19 being published as preprints have already been reported ( heimstädt , 2020 ; marcus &amp; oransky , 2020 ) . it should be noted though that this is not specific to preprints , as journal articles can require from post-publication corrections and retractions as well ( horbach &amp; halffman , 2019 ) . several articles related to covid-19 have already gone through this process ( gautret et al. , 2020 ) . from the publishers ' side , several journals and publishers are currently modifying their editorial procedures and policies to warrant fast dissemination of relevant information . for instance , elife announced it would curtail requests for additional experiments during revisions , suspend its deadline for submitting revisions , make the posting of preprints to biorxiv or medrxiv the default for all elife submissions , and it would specifically mobilize early-career researchers to become reviewing editors and reviewers in order to extent the journal 's reviewer pool ( eisen , akhmanova , behrens , &amp; weigel , 2020 ) . similarly , nature put out an open invitation to researchers with relevant expertise to review covid-19 related papers over short time ( `` coronavirus pandemic : nature 's pledge to you , '' 2020 ) . hence , journals and publishers are aiming to attract reviewers that can assist in the rapid publication of new findings , relevant to tackle the health crisis . the medical journal of australia ( mja ) has drafted policies related to both preprints are rapid peer review , setting up 'fast lanes ' for covid-19 related research : '' the mja has stepped up to play its part in meeting this crisis , including ultra-rapid review of sars-cov-2 manuscripts and pre-print publication of unedited papers , to ensure that the newest data and viewpoints are available as soon as possible . '' ( talley , 2020 ) the royal society open publishing announced to establish a similar fast lane for their registered reports on covid-19 related content . they have even gathered a group of 700 reviewers who have committed to review a paper in 24 to 48 hours when called up on ( brock , 2020 ) . the journal also acknowledges one of the major concerns related to these fast dissemination models : `` the ultra-rapid review and publication model entails a risk of error , but sharing important information too slowly is a much greater hazard . '' ( talley , 2020 ) in this article , we assess whether the scholarly publishing community succeeds in speeding up the dissemination of covid-19 related content . to do so , we assess the use of preprint servers , the uptake of preprint articles in academic journals , and the duration of journals ' publication process both prior to and during the present pandemic . for our analysis , we use a repository of covid-19 related research articles established by the centre for science and technology studies ( cwts ) . the repository is based on databases of cord19 , dimensions and the world health organisation ( who ) , and includes articles on covid-19 , sars-cov-2 , and related ( corona ) viruses and infectious diseases . in particular , this means that the database contains journal articles and preprints that predate the current covid-19 pandemic , as it for instance also includes articles on the 2002 sars virus and disease . for brevity 's sake , all such articles will in the remainder of this article by described as 'covid-19 related ' articles . a full description of the database as well as access to all relevant data is available ( cwts , 2020 ) . colavizza et al . ( 2020 ) provide a description and analysis of parts of this database . all results in this article are based on the april 4 release of the database . we note that the majority of articles in the dataset originates from the cord19 database . some doubt has been raised about the relevance of some of this database 's articles to the current pandemic ( colavizza et al. , 2020 ) , but for our purposes , the scope of the database seems reasonable . based on this dataset , several analyses were performed : we analysed the duration of the publication process , in number of days , for a sample of 529 journal articles . 259 articles were published during the present pandemic ( i.e . from jan 1 , 2020 ) and 270 were published prior to the pandemic ( i.e . before oct 1 , 2019 ) . the articles were published in 14 different journals . journals were selected based on their number of articles both prior to and during the current pandemic as well as the availability of data on when articles were submitted , accepted and published . we selected the ten journals publishing most covid-19 related articles in general , supplemented by the five journals publishing most covid-19 related content since the start of the pandemic , that make publication data ( submission , acceptance and publish ) available . one journal , viruses , matches both criteria . the list of journals used in this analysis , including their number of articles , as well as the journals discarded because no data on submission , acceptance or publication dates was available , is added as supplementary material a. from those journals , we sampled all articles published since the start of the pandemic and matched those to an equal number of articles published in the same journal prior to the pandemic to form a control group . in case the control group had fewer articles , we used this number of articles and only selected the most recent articles after the pandemic . in case less than ten articles were published since the start of the pandemic , we nonetheless sampled ten articles for the control group . for the control group , we sampled articles starting with publications in 2019 ( but before oct 1 st ) and moving backwards , in order to make sure editorial policies most closely resemble those in the pandemic . table 1 presents the list of journals used , including the number of articles sampled per journal . information on the dates of submission , acceptance and publication was manually retrieved from the journal 's webpage . in case journals distinguished between publication online and appearance in the print issue of the journal , we selected the date of online publication . to control for potential effects specific to covid-19 related papers , we selected , for all journals in our sample , the ten most recently published articles ( as of april 16 th , 2020 ) about non-covid-19 related content . in particular , these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning covid-19 , coronavirus , sars-cov-2 , or cov-19 in their title , keywords and abstract . all the 140 articles in this control group were published during the current pandemic , with 64 % published in april 2020 , 32 % in march , 1 % in february , and 3 % in january . we assessed the usage of preprint servers as a fast way of disseminating academic knowledge by counting the number of preprints on covid-19 related content both during and before the current pandemic . for this we used all preprints in de database , and did use a more narrow sampling strategy . hence , we include all covid-19 related preprints . in addition , we analysed the number of preprints that also appeared as journal articles , and the average number of days between publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article . the analysis is based on the linkage of preprints and journal articles in the dimensions database ( https : //docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/index.html ) . figure 2 compares the overall duration of journals ' publication process prior to and during the present pandemic . it demonstrates that , on average , journals have drastically increased the speed of their processes for covid-19 publications : average turnaround times in our journal sample has decreased from 117 to 60 days . comparing the 95 % confidence intervals of both statistics , shows the decrease to be highly substantial and significant . the copyright holder for this preprint ( which was not peer-reviewed ) is the . table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the average duration of the publication process for covid-19 related articles in journals in our sample . it distinguishes between the periods before and during the pandemic and it splits the entire publication process in the review stage ( between submission and acceptance ) and editorial stage ( between acceptance and submission ) . figure 3 presents a graphical overview of the average decrease in turnaround time in the period during the crisis compared to the period prior to the pandemic . it again distinguishes between the review and editorial stages of the publication process . note that negative numbers in this case indicate an increase in turnaround time . the figure indicates the review stage shortens for ten out of the fourteen journals in our sample , while nine journals managed to shorten their editorial stage . average acceleration is around 50 % for both stages , but it goes up to nearly 100 % in some journals . to check whether the acceleration of publication processes is specific to covid-19 related papers , we analysed the turnaround times for non-covid-19 related articles published since the start of the pandemic . for all journals in our sample , we selected the ten most recently published articles ( as of april 16 th , 2020 ) about non-covid-19 related content . in particular , these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning covid-19 , coronavirus , sars-cov-2 , or cov-19 in their title , keywords and abstract . for these articles we also analysed the turnaround times of their publication process . results are presented in figure 4 . the figure indicates that for most journals , articles not related to covid-19 have very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic . unpacking the publication process in the review and editorial stage , we conclude that , again , non-covid-19 related articles follow a very similar pattern to articles published before the pandemic . some of the most prominent , high impact medical journals are not part of our sample , because they do not share all relevant data on submission , acceptance and publication dates . comparing the total number of published articles in high impact journals such as bmj , the lancet , jama and nejm does not give a clear indication of faster publication : these four journals published 864 , 421 , 351 , and 307 articles respectively in 2020 , according to a web of science search . over the same period in 2019 they published 874 , 497 , 335 , and 334 articles respectively . hence , most show a small decrease in the total number of published articles . consequently , if they managed to speed up their publication process for covid-19 related articles , this has gone at the expense of other content being published less , or less quickly . next we turn our analysis towards the publication of preprints . as was shown in figure 1 , the number of preprints on covid-19 related content has seen a sharp increase since the outbreak of the pandemic . in total 2102 preprints were published on seven preprint servers : ssrn electronic journal , biorxiv , chemrxiv , jmir preprints , research square , and medrxiv . we note that even though arxiv publications are included in the dimensions database , they are not included in the 4 april release of the dataset we used , due to technical issues . out of the 2102 preprints in our dataset , 129 have currently also appeared as journal article . due to the small number of preprints appearing as journal articles , no statistically relevant conclusions can be drawn about the uptake of preprints in journals . however , analyse the average duration between the publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article we see a steady increase , ranging from , on average , 137 days in 2017 and just over 200 days in 2020. currently , we do not see any indication of acceleration of the uptake of preprints in journals since the outbreak of all but one of these preprint-journal article pairs were published prior to the current pandemic . however , comparing the results in tables 1 and 2 , it becomes clear that turnaround times for articles that previously appeared as preprints are much shorter than the average turnaround times in these journals . in fact , for these pre-pandemic articles , turnaround times are even shorter than their postpandemic counterparts . our analysis indicates that the scholarly publishing enterprise has managed to drastically speed up the dissemination of covid-19 related research material since the outbreak of the pandemic . in particular , academic journals managed to decrease the duration of their publication process by 49 % , or 57 days on average , which is a statistically relevant difference . some journals even show a decrease in publication time of over 80 % compared to the pre-crisis era . this acceleration concerns both the stage of review ( between submission and acceptance ) and the editing stage ( between acceptance and publication ) . the journals in our sample shortened both stages by 47 % ( 45 days ) and 61 % ( 14 days ) respectively . hence the majority of the decrease in total publication time is due to speeding up the review process . we also conclude that the acceleration of the publication process is specific to covid-19 related articles . articles not related to covid-19 published during the pandemic show very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic . in addition to a fast spread of information through journal articles , the number of papers submitted to preprint servers has drastically increased . however , such preprints do not seem to be taken up as journal publications any quicker than they were before the covid-19 pandemic . nevertheless , articles first appearing as preprints do seem to go through shorter publication processes than articles not appearing as preprints . to tackle the current health crisis , many have urged to disseminate relevant academic knowledge as fast as possible . acknowledging that typical publication delays in medical journals are unacceptable in the current era , journals are expected to decrease the turnaround times of their publication process . the results of our study indicate that journals have indeed managed to do so . our results on the average turnaround times of journal articles prior to the current pandemic corresponds well with earlier findings of studies on publication delays in medical journals ( björk &amp; solomon , 2013 ) . however , since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic , medical journals have managed to drastically accelerate their publication process to make it nearly twice as fast for covid-19 related articles . on the contrary , articles not related to covid-19 that were published since the beginning of the pandemic , do not show any acceleration . their turnaround times are similar to articles published before the pandemic . while it seems reasonable that journals might encounter difficulties to attract reviewers with relevant expertise -since those are probably active scientists working on novel research themselves -the contrary seems to be the case . concluding from our results , it seems that journals are finding enough reviewers willing to review covid-19 related papers on a very short notice . however , this conclusion should be treated with caution , as no data is available on who reviewed the papers . maybe the same few experts reviewed a lot more than usual ; maybe 'relevant expertise ' was taken as a relative criterion , with journals using reviewers that usually would not have counted as experts . the fact that non-covid-19 related papers are published at similar speeds during and before the pandemic , seems to indicate that journals are also not facing more issues with attracting reviewers for those papers . as preprint articles are not being included in medical journals more quickly , it seems that either authors are not submitting preprint articles to journals more quickly , or journals are prioritizing content that has not appeared as preprint . qualitative follow-up research interviewing authors and editors on their submission and review practices regarding preprint articles could shed further light on this . even though the acceleration of journals ' publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination , it also raises several questions and concerns . first , one could wonder whether faster is always better . even though the two do not necessarily exclude each other , it seems reasonable that there is a balance , or perhaps even a trade-off , between speed and quality in peer review . especially concerning the stage of review , legitimate concerns can be raised on whether speeding up the review process might harm the process ' ability to filter incorrect or invalid findings . such research slipping through peer review , might require corrections or retractions in the future . given the potentially rapid uptake of medical knowledge in policy and clinical contexts , such corrections might come in too late as potential harm might have already been done . commentators have raised this concern regarding the usage of information in preprints , but it similarly applies to journal articles . in fact , false information spreading through journal articles is arguably more damaging , since it has the appearance of being 'peer reviewed ' and hence properly verified . scholars have repeatedly warned that a substantial share of articles ( hastily ) published during this crisis , will require future corrections ( marcus &amp; oransky , 2020 ) . formal expressions of concern -on papers used to make policy decisions -have already been issued ( voss , 2020 ) . future research should therefore analyse whether shorter review processes during the covid-19 pandemic have led to an increase in corrections or retractions of published articles . while drastic acceleration of the review stage might evoke quality issues , this arguably applies less to the editorial stage of the publication process . journals ' achievement of shortening this stage of the publication process for covid-19 related content is purely laudable . however , this might raise questions about why publication delays in this stage are usually higher and whether journals will aim and be able to maintain such standards in a post-crisis era . one potential explanation for the shortened editorial stage is that publishers or journal editors now prioritize covid-19 related research articles , at the expense of other articles . however , our data on non-covid-19 related articles published during the pandemic seems to contradict this . it seems like journals are managing to speed up editorial work for covid-19 related content , while maintaining standards for other articles . several journals show a substantial lengthening of the editorial stage . this might be caused by an increase in the number of manuscripts submitted to the respective journals . for journals showing an increase in total turnaround time , this seems to be concentrated in the editorial process . since editors themselves might be practicing scientists , the overload of newly submitted manuscripts might be a cause of this additional delay . this study potentially suffers from various limitations in its analysis . first , it could only analyse those journal articles that have been published . this particularly implies that it was unable to assess the review process ' duration for rejected articles . neither could it analyse articles that are currently still under review . second , the analysis does not include article type as a feature of analysis . some article types , including letters to the editor , perspectives or commentaries , might undergo a different kind of peer reviewthey might for instance only be reviewed by the editor , rather than by external reviewers . a potential difference in distribution of pre-and post-crisis articles over the various article types might explain some of the variation in the publication process ' duration . third , our analyses focus on journals publishing relatively many covid-19 related articles . due to a lack of sufficient articles in other , potentially smaller journals , we were not able to analyse those journals . as larger journals may more easily attract reviewers and have more resources , and hence more capacity to shift resources , to execute the editorial stage of publication , the resulting decrease in publication time might be less strong in smaller journals . at a later stage , when more covid-19 related papers appear in other journals , future research could verify this potential difference . last , it should be noted that some of the journal articles assigned to our control group concern papers related to previous health crises or pandemics such as the mesh , ebola or zika crises . despite similar incentives to publish those articles quickly , content related to covid-19 makes its way through the publication process much quicker . future research could include a more elaborate comparison not only between pre-and post-covid-19 eras , but also between publishing in the covid-19 and other health related crises . in these times of crisis , the rapid dissemination of relevant academic knowledge is of paramount importance . several stakeholders have already warned for a 'fake-news pandemic ' spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories through social media channels in the absence of established . cc-by 4.0 international license author/funder . it is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint ( which was not peer-reviewed ) is the . https : //doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.045963 doi : biorxiv preprint scientific knowledge ( khatri et al. , 2020 ; unesco , 2020 ) . to assist policymakers and clinical experts , as well as to counter the spread of such disinformation , researchers and academic journals have a responsibility to share available knowledge quickly . the fact that medical journals have managed to considerably speed up their publication process for covid-19 related content during the current pandemic is therefore laudable . however , some concerns remain about whether faster dissemination might go at the expense of research quality . quickly spreading false information might do more harm than slowly spreading reliable knowledge .</td>\n",

As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach.

All steps beginning with frozen nuclei are performed in single PCR tubes through to barcoded library amplication and cleanup, ready for pooling and DNA sequencing. Our CUT&Tag@home protocol has minimal equipment, reagent and supply needs and does not require handling of toxic or biologically active materials. We show that data quality and reproducibility for samples down to ~100 nuclei compare favorably to datasets produced using lab-based CUT&Tag and other chromatin profiling methods.

The duration of scholarly journals' publication process is one of the main factors hindering quick delivery of new information. While proper editorial assessment and peer review obviously require some time, turnaround times for medical journals can be up to several months, which is undesirable in the era of a crisis. Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals' publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review.\", 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]   \n",

       "0  We develop a new way to predict the recovery rate of infections following a pandemic outbreak, using the basic postulates of learning theory. This theory has been previously applied to outcome, accident and event data from multiple socio-technological systems, like transportation, medicine, military, power grids, aviation, mining, and manufacturing. Learning theory simply postulates that humans learn from experience in correcting their mistakes and errors (sometimes even just by trial and error), as they gain knowledge on the problem and skill for addressing it. The theory is consistent with the models and data in cognitive psychology of how humans behave and the brain operates (Ohlsson, 1996; Fiondella and Duffey, 2015; Anderson, 1990; Duffey, 2017b) . The importance of this theory stands in that human errors and incorrect decisions are the dominant contributors to accidents, crashes, system failures, errors, and operational incidents.\\nThe theory is based on the fact that human learning demonstrably reduces error rates (Ohlsson, 1996) : wisdom is gained after an accident. Evidence on this relates to even highly hazardous industries like the nuclear one. A good example is that the safe operation of nuclear power plants has been, and continuous to be, improved from lessons learned from nuclear accidents and incidents. These accidents and incidents, in addition to highlighting the role of human errors in their occurrence and progression, have helped identifying various critical technical elements and contributed to the safer operation of nuclear power plants. Similarly, the observation is applicable to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Improving health systems following epidemic outbreaks and enhancing reliability and safety measures following nuclear power plant accidents have to be handled with objective data and accurate calculations. However, whereas nuclear power plant operation has done this by a world-accepted, high standard of procedures, the \"protection system\" against pandemics is not there yet. The key is how to design, evaluate and implement the procedures, for reaching a high standard.\\nLearning theory has been successfully applied to quantify error and learning rates in technical systems, casualties in large land battles, everyday accident and event data, and to human, software and hardware reliability (Duffey and Saull, 2008; Duffey & Ha, 2010; Fiondella & Duffey, 2015; Duffey, 2017a) . The novel feature is to replace calendar time or test interval, which has always been used before, with a measure for the accumulated experience and/or risk exposure, thus defining rate trends and quantifying effectiveness of responses to errors and accidents, and allowing totally different systems to be directly intercompared. Additionally, the trend is governed by two parameters that are physically based: the learning rate constant and the minimum achievable error rate. This is in contrast with statistical analysis ,where fitting to learning data is typically done on three empirical parameters (Bush and Mosteller, 1955 ) , and with the inverse \"power laws\" extensively fitted in cognitive psychology data ( e.g. Anderson, 1990 and the references therein).\\nThe theory shows the Learning Hypothesis that humans learn from their mistakes and reduce outcomes in such a way that the rate of decrease of the outcome (in the present case of interest, the infection rate, R) with the rate of accumulated experience, ε, (in the present case the advancement in the knowledge of the virus, the contagion spreading dynamics, the effects of the countermeasures) is proportional to the rate R itself. Thus, very simply, the differential equation that describes the accident and outcome data with learning or forgetting describes the proportionality between the rate of change of the learning rate, R, and the learning rate itself (Duffey and Saull, 2008; Duffey, 2017b) :\\nwhere ε is the measure of the risk exposure, learning opportunity or experience/knowledge gained; k is the learning rate (positive for a learning/improving situation and negative for no learning/improving, e.g. because of no effectiveness countermeasures) and Rm is the lowest or minimum achievable error rate, which is never zero as the process of error-making and cognitive rule revision always continues. Physically, k is related to the non-detection or error rate in unconscious memory scanning for recall and recognition, manifesting itself in the conscious external actions, decisions and judgments. The error rate solution obtained from integration of this Minimum Error Rate equation (MERE) is:\\nwhere, 0 is the initial rate at the beginning or start of the problem when the level of experience/knowledge on it is ε= ε0. Different data sets are characterized by different values of the learning constant.\\nIt is clear in Equation (2) that for practical applications a suitable measure of the experience/knowledge or risk exposure accumulated with respect to the initial one, (ε-ε0), is needed and that the original or starting one, ε0, is a suitable arbitrary or convenient reference dependent on the problem at hand. In other words, the measure for the accumulated experience/knowledge or risk exposure is technology/system specific. Then, for data inter-comparisons, it is useful to render non-dimensional the quantities of interest, which results in the Universal Learning Curve (ULC) for the non-dimensional error rate E*= (R(ε)-Rm)/(R0-Rm) as a function of the non-dimensional experience/knowledge or risk exposure ε* = ε/ εT, where εT is the maximum accumulated experience or risk exposure thanks to which the error is recovered (the problem is considered under control), its rate having reached the lowest or minimum achievable value Rm. From (2), * =\\nwith K~ 3 is the fitted learning rate \"universal constant\". This expression has already been shown to represent the learning trends for outcome rate data from industrial, surgical, transportation, mining, manufacturing, chemical, maintenance, software and a multitude of other systems (Duffey and Saull, 2008; Ha, 2013: Fiondella and Duffey, 2015) . For skill acquisition tasks in cognitive psychological testing, this same trend exists and is called the Universal Law of Practice (ULP).\\nIllnesses are still around in the world, many of them deadly. In the past, there have been pandemics1 killing many millions of people, like the \"Black Death\" or Bubonic Plague disease of the Middle Ages, and the influenza epidemic in 1918. In addition to these sudden attacks, other equally deadly pestilences have been and are still around for centuriesyellow fever, cholera, small pox, typhus, measles, malaria.... As modern medical practice eliminated or reduced these hazards using better procedures and new vaccines, other exotic variants and viruses have recently emerged, like SARS, HIV, Ebola and CoViD19, infecting and endangering the ever-increasing and interconnected world population. As we evolve and learn, so do the things that like to kill us, but they usually kill relatively few people compared to, say, automobile accidents or the yearly seasonal influenza.\\nTo determine risk from these instances, we can and must turn to data. As a fine example, we have the official data from the World Health Organization. The WHO gave the death rates for \"all causes\" and for infectious (like cholera) and parasitic (like malaria) diseases for some 194 countries in the mid 1990s. The data cover the full global spectrum, from developed to developing nations, from vast urban conglomerates with very crowded living conditions to scattered rural communities, from jungles to deserts, and all Continents. The data cover and include the effects of modern epidemics, and of course local wars and regional conflicts.\\nIn Figure 1 , the data are plotted not against the usual arbitrary calendar year but-as we now know we should -against the risk exposure measure, in this case the population size. This number is the direct indicator of how many people are at risk, and the country-bycountry populations come from the World Bank Indicators. The data are plotted in the Figure with the lozenges being the overall death rate data and the squares representing the death rate data due to infections.\\nFrom these data, we can know the risk of death from any health cause: it is about 1000 deaths for every 100,000 people, or one in a hundred, and does not depend much on where you live. To verify this overall number \"locally\", we can analyze the data for New York, as given in the graph \"The Conquest of Pestilence in New York City\" from 1800 onwards, published by the Board of Health and the Health Department. This is a typical modern city that had grown in population from 120,000 to about 8 million people, and includes characteristics of immigration, high-density living, mass transportation, high-rise apartments, modern health care, national and international trade, and a large flow of inbound-outbound travel, in other words, globalization. The biggest improvement in health has come from introducing effective hygiene and anti-infection measures, and from improved health prevention and treatment (not from wonder drugs): we have learned how to treat sick people, cure problems and reduce the spread of bad diseases. It is an expensive investment and it is hard work that requires devoted and trained professionals. As a result, after curing and containing many pestilences during the 19th century, the average death rate in New York over the last hundred years has fallen to 10 to 11 per 1000 people, or almost exactly the same one-in-a-hundred rate as the world rate. So modern cities behave pretty much like whole countries, as far as average or overall death rates are concerned.\\nInfectious and parasitic diseases are responsible for 5 to 15 deaths in 100,000 people, so average about one in ten thousand or 1 to 5% of all deaths worldwide, the other 95 to 99% or so being deaths from \"normal\" causes. So the \"normal\" death risk is still about twenty to a hundred times of what it might be if a new pestilence emerges, spreads and takes hold without effective countermeasures.\\nAnother way to view this risk contribution is to say that the chance of death might be increased by a maximum of about 5% if a new global pandemic infection occurs where it has not been prevalent before. This is always the fear, that in today's highly interconnected, high-speed, global world a possible rapid spread of new or variant diseases can occur.\\nAll rights reserved.

There was extensive reporting of nearly every new case occurring and great worldwide information available (e.g. at Johns Hopkins University website coronavirus.jhu.edu/map). By late March 2020, the world had over 1,000,000 cases (and still growing at the time of writing) and many thousands of deaths, with the infection having spread quickly across borders, imported from nation-to-nation mainly via travellers, visitors and tourists, and spread internally from just social and day-to-day human contact.\\nLooking at the available numbers, the individual infection risk today is comparatively negligible, with a few hundred thousand cases in a world population of several billion. It is an individual random infection probability, p(I), of about one in twenty thousand. This risk is many times less than the chance of being hospitalized with influenza, let alone catching it, reflecting the existing fraction of world deaths due to infections.\\nBut the high speed at which this virus has spread makes it legitimate to feel worried and unease, and correspondingly, legitimate questions arise:\\nHow does this novel pandemic compare to the \"normal\" or accepted risk of infectious death?\\nWhat is the \"worst case\" scenario?\\nShould we panic and shun other people who may be carrying what might kill us?\\nHow long will it take to recover?\\nThis calls for the need to try to objectively evaluate the risk, based on the current experience knowledge.\\nWe normally can treat the spread of disease as a \"diffusion\" or \"multiple contact\" process, where it steadily expands outward from some central source or origin; or as a highly mobile source that is potentially spread everywhere due to rapid multiple global personal and social interactions. The excellent US Centers for Disease Control simply states the obvious:\\n\"Risk depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people\"\\n(Source: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary)\\nThe data from China on CoVid-19 infections suggest that there is, or was, a 50%-90% chance of the initial infections spreading between cities, depending on location and size (Du et al , 2020) . Using simple doubling rates, the news media carried projections that a \"worst case\" in the USA could infect over 200 million (i.e. most people in the USA) and cause nearly 2 million or so deaths, and experts were hard at work estimating global, country and age-dependent risks, including of death.\\nWe certainly need to estimate or know the risk of infection. As a simple guess and knowing nothing else, let us assume infections are randomly transmitted anywhere and everywhere from person to person, the spread is instantaneous and guaranteed if a source exists and the probability of being (successfully!) infected is also random and equally possible. This is really a \"worst case\" scenario or \"model\", as obviously not everyone is exposed to everyone and not everyone is equally vulnerable. The worst case scenario is, then, that there is no preventative measures, no immunity and no vaccine, and for whatever reason, the source is not quarantined or isolated, and any such infected person or mobile source can and does transmit the virus (or disease) randomly to others somewhere in the world.\\nIndependent of the transmission mechanism, given contact, the probability of crossinfection, then, depends solely on the total numbers of the possibly equally risk-or infection-exposed recipient population, and the probability of infection is also random. In this model, anyone can get it by interacting with someone that has it2. To help see this more clearly, the black balls (the \"unknowns\") emerging from the Jar of Life is one way to view what might happen based on what we have already seen or been exposed to. Here the one black ball (n=1) is an \"known unknown\" infected person or infection opportunity among those ten (m=10) non-infected (\"known knowns\") white balls (m=10), so a chance of 10% or one over ten. The probability of interest is, then, of infection for more people exposed and infected, or N \"unknown unknowns\", and some not exposed or not successfully infected, M \"unknown knowns\") , out of a total of all exposed people, N+M.\\nThese numbers, N and M, vary by city, country, cruise ship passengers, soccer matches or rock concert arena, and can systematically vary up to the total of about six billions or so in the global world. We can also think of it as our possible exposure experience. The formula for the probability p of the event of an individual I becoming infected takes the form, p(I) = Number infected (N) / total number exposed (N+M).\\nIf there is a gathering limit of ten or so people, as in the case of the white and black balls of the Jar of Life shown in the picture, the observed chance of being infected, p(I), is assumed to be about one infection (black ball) in some ten non-infections (white balls), or 10%. This we know. But the sample is limited to 10 and, so, we could also be exposed to one in a hundred, or one in a thousand, or more: how many more infection cases would we, then, expect out there hidden in the Jar?\\nThe method used to estimate this probability is random sampling based on the so-called hypergeometric formula3. For possible gathering numbers of 10,100, 300 and 1000 with one infection source known or observed, the chance of observing or finding, say, 100,000 new cases of infection, p(I) in a bigger group rises to a maximum or peak of about 37 % (about one in three)4.\\nThe estimate that comes out in this \"worst case scenario\" seemingly agrees with the estimates publicly available on the internet and social media of the awful possibility (risk) of perhaps even a 40-70% chance of being at risk of infection, if nothing is done to prevent it or reduce it5. That is a significant and very high risk of infection, and has been used to justify quarantining, limiting social gatherings and extensive travel restrictions.\\nThis inevitably brings fear to the individuals of the global population and the only way to address fear is by using scientific knowledge and data to inform any theory behind estimates and predictions.\\nDuring the early onset of the CoVid-19 pandemic, many gloomy scenarios were made and analyzed but they generally assumed no effective countermeasures to the spread of infections. The infection numbers grew quickly at first, before countermeasures such as isolation, distancing, restrictions and curfews were implemented to reduce infection rates and \"flatten the curve\" of numbers versus time. Sad to say, deaths (distressing as they are) are also NOT the right measure-infections are the measure for the spread and control of infectious diseases. A logical question is whether the infection or death data show any signs that we are learning how to reduce risk?\\nJust like for any accident-the number killed or dying is highly variable depending on who and how many risk-exposed happens to be there, so it is random. In this viral case, the number of deaths also just depends on too many uncontrolled variables and factors (age, pre-existing health conditions, health care system, propensity etc. …) so the average death percentage per infection also varies in magnitude, location and time (as the data clearly show). The correct measure is infection numbers and rates (not the number of deaths), say the number per day. The infections numbers also depend on which country/region they refer to and at what infectious stage (early onset, spread extent, countermeasures employed ... etc.). We already know that if uncontrolled, the increase in infections will rise exponentially, as the rate of infections is proportional to the number infected.\\nAs usual, the most representative case can be based on actual infection data from where containment of contagion has already been successfully applied, namely in China where it originated. Using data reported by the John Hopkins Center for System Science and Engineering, by March, 2020, there were, n= 81,000 infections and some 3200 deaths in China with a falling to near-zero rate. So with a national population of N+M =1,400,000,000, the overall probable risk of infection is about 0.00006, or one in 17,000, (or about six in 100,000)6. Locally, in some cities/regions it is ten times higher, but although comparable to infectious death rates, the overall CoVid-19 death rate in China was on average one in nearly half a million people, much lower than deaths from other infectious diseases. That is a significant reduction in the risk of infection: countermeasures have worked.\\nSo far, we have these scenarios:\\nThe scary or \"Worst\" with no measures: at least one in three people infected.\\nThe real or \"Best\" control and mitigation: only one in 17000 people infected.\\nThe probable Future is the Past modified by the Likelihood.\\nSo the possible probability reduction , or Likelihood, must be considered in a future estimate based on projections using past data. This simple-minded upper and lower limit comparison suggests the individual Likelihood is about 0.0002, or very low. Societal countermeasures reduced the risk by a factor of 500 to 5000 over the inevitable \"worst case\" random spread of infection or survival-of-only-the-fittest scenarios.\\nThe approach based on Learning Theory illustrated in this Section uses the fact that humans learn how to control the CoVid-19 outbreak spread and reduce infection rates using countermeasures (treatments, isolation, \"social distancing\" etc). IF these are effective the rate, therefore, must reach a peak and, then, decline. To look at pandemic recovery, we really need to look at the rate of infections, NOT just deaths since these depend on too many social and personal health factors as already stated.\\nThese include propensity, age profile, medical system effectiveness, treatment options early detection, etc. The risk of an infectious disease is not controlled unless the infection rate slows down, so-called 'flattening the curve\". Once the rate peaks the rate, then, should decrease due to successful countermeasures (whatever they are).\\nSo, the next question is: what happens next and how do we know how effective the control measures are, and how long before they can be relaxed or maintained?\\nIn China, the actual infection rates (increase per day) rose to a peak of nearly 4000 a day in about 17 to 20 days, and, then, fell away steadily to about 50 or so a day by another 30 days. As a further consideration for a different country, S Korea had a different peak rate of about 1000 per day in ten days, falling to a low rate in another 10 or so days.\\nIn Italy, after some delay in implementing countermeasures, the infection rate seemingly peaked at about 6000 per day in about 30 or so days, as can be seen in the graph of Figure  3 . As of writing, (early April) this rate has decreased to nearly 4000 per day (see graph in the Figure) .\\nThe results for all countries that show some form of recovery are reported in the Figure 4 graph, which plots as, E*, the non-dimensional infection rate normalized to the initial peak value, versus N* = ε/ εT, the non-dimensional elapsed time of experience/knowledge or risk \\nItaly data All rights reserved.

In relation to the equations (1) and (2) of learning theory above, the infection rate takes the role of the error rate R, the risk exposure time, ε , corresponds to the accumulated experience/knowledge from which we learn and is measured in days, the time of peak εT, is the time for the rate to approach its achievable minimum value, Rm (the lowest or minimum achievable error rate, in equation (2). Based on the available data for China and S Korea, using countermeasures, the overall recovery timescale is about 20-30 days to attain the minimum infection rate of about 50 per day .\\nFor further direct comparison, we plot also the reduction curve of the world pulmonary disease death rate per day for 1870 -1970 (Source: Human Nature, T.McKeown, April, 1978 as given in Horwitz and Ferleger \"Statistics for Social Change\"). We can simply think of this overall World data over the years, and its reduction trend, as resulting from many pandemics and multiple outbreaks of influenzas and differing virus strains, that have been more and more successfully treated as we have learned to better control/reduce infections and improved effect recovery, thus steadily reducing the rate.\\nDespite the huge differences in timescales, the \"recovery rate curve\" is simply the exponential Universal Learning Curve of equation (3) The CoVid -19 pandemic and pulmonary disease recovery rate data all fit with the Universal Learning Curve trend (which is known to fit millions of events with learning). The infection rate, E*, normalized to the initial peak value, as a function of the time elapsed The key point is that all the data follow almost exactly the same decreasing trajectory and, furthermore, the learning curve is nearly the same (K~3), as previously found for any learning experience on outcomes, accidents, events of any other modern technological system operated by humans. Indeed, the results surprisingly follow the curve developed some ten years after it was first discovered, while working on completely different data. We can claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction also in this case of the pandemic, and call it the Universal Recovery Curve.\\nTo further confirm the URC general theoretical correlation, we next compare to the latest projections for medical resource loads made by complex computer modeling of infections and deaths in the USA ( IHME, 2020 ). As a reasonable surrogate measure, the number of required hospital beds was assumed to be proportional to the number of infections, which daily values were directly transcribed from the website graph (available at covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america). The interval available is a projection from a peak resource use on April 15th out to July 1st, 2020, so to be consistent with the actual available country data. The infection rate per day, R, was calculated until attaining an assumed but realistic minimum rate, Rm, of 50 per day on 10th June (55 days later).\\nAll rights reserved.

Korea open triangles) and the widely used IHME model projections with the Universal Learning Curve shown in the Figures 4 and 5 are compelling. The data fits with learning curve theory, which we know already incidentally fits millions of events, accidents and trends. China, Italy and S. Korea have indeed learned how to control the spread of a viral pandemic. All other countries/systems/people have to do to predict the infection rate evolution is to follow the same trend after first reaching their rate peak. This type of analysis allows countries and systems to compare the effectiveness of their countermeasures implemented to control the pandemics and the related timescales.\\nA word of caution is necessary, however, these numbers cannot be exact and are not meant to be exact. These are just calculated risk estimates, which are subject to uncertainty related to all the many endogenous factors related to the virus spreading, and the actuation and respect of the measures implemented. The numbers provide guidance to thinking about the absolute risk and the best approach to take given the risk is constant unless we do nothing to reduce it! The strong message here is that the rational and logical approach to dealing with the risk of the occurring pandemic (as with any other risk, for that matter) is to limit own personal and potential exposure, and to minimize both the size and scale of the potentially exposed population. This is precisely what governments and contagious disease experts have been saying all along-but is also what any individual should be doing anyway while exposed to the risks of \"normal\" life. A sort of ethics of resilience (B. Rajaonah and E. Zio, 2020).\\nIn the above graph of Figure 4 , the infection reduction/recovery rate for Italy was estimated to occur in about 30 days, by assuming it was a timeframe similar to that of China. The present prediction is, then, that there is at least a 30-day recovery timeframe as the horizon for the infection rate to get down to a minimum achievable level of say 50 per day (as for China); infection rates should be below 10% of the peak (i.e. about 600 per day) in about 3 weeks from the peak. But this prediction can be effectively monitored and should be updated as more data arises. In fact, at present, only very few days have elapsed since the seemingly reached peak rate, so it is useful to look at a future trajectory. This can be done as in Figure 6 , by plotting the data simply changing the denominator of the non-dimensional elapsed time after the peak rate N* from the 30 days (27 March to 27 April) assumed in analogy to China, to say 20 days (27 March to 6 April) or 40 days (27 March to 6 May) for estimated reduction to the (non-zero) minimum (i.e. 50-100 per day). This sensitivity analysis allows to verify, based on objective data, whether or not any change or improvement in countermeasures is warranted, and by how much. The calculations can assume the infection rate peaked either on about 24 March or March 29, the latter being shown as giving the fewest data points (see Figure 6 above)\\nIn this paper, we have originally proposed to adapt Learning Theory for describing the reduction of pandemic infections like that of CoVid-19. A key point is to look at infection rate, as a measure of error outcome, and time, as a measure of experience/knowledge or risk exposure which allows learning. The analyses of the currently available data show that the CoVid-19 infection rate data follow, after peaking, almost exactly the Universal Learning Curve describing the decreasing trajectory of many other instances where humans learn to apply effective countermeasures. More specifically, the learning curve is nearly the same (with universal constant K~3) as for any learning experience reducing outcomes, accidents and events for other modern technological system operated by humans.

       "1  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, a city located in central China, in early December, is fast spreading to more than 30 countries (Benvenuto et al., 2020; She et al., 2020) . In less than 3 months, the disease has infected more than 70,000 people globally, and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. On January 30 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. Upon composing this manuscript, the coronavirus is concurrently spreading and claiming more than 100 lives per day. This outbreak induces an urgency to determine the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and implement optimal strategies to control the epidemic.\\nCoronavirus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus found in a variety of mammals, including bats, civets, camel, and pangolins (Ge et al., 2013; Kandeil et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2007; Rockx et al., 2011) . Two strains of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, have been reported to cause severe respiratory syndromes, resulting in deadly epidemics in 2002 and 2012, respectively (Fung and Liu, 2019; Luk et al., 2019) . This current coronavirus, denoted as SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans. (Benvenuto et al., 2020) .\\nTo effectively fight and end the COVID-19 epidemic, the transmission of the disease and zoonotic source of origin must be accurately identified, leading to the discovery of an optimal strategy to control this outbreak. By studying the cases and clinical features from early reports, this paper illustrates rigorous epidemiological models and the associated statistical methods to estimate the transmission rates in different stages and scenarios and predict the outcomes for different control strategies.\\nThe numbers of cases from January 21 st to February 20 th , 2020 were obtained from the daily reports by National Health Commission (NHC) of China. As NHC did not release case reports until January 21 st , the case numbers prior to January 21 st were obtained from two recent clinical reports (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . The number of patients diagnosed out of Wuhan was obtained from the report by which summarized 1,099 cases confirmed by January 29 th , 2020. The case numbers for the Diamond Princess Cruise were obtained from the daily reports by Yokohama Port Quarantine Center.\\nA susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine model was used for transmission analysis and prediction of epidemiological spread,\\nCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 where S, E, I, Q and N were the number of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), quarantined (Q) and total population. The population in Wuhan (N) is 11,081,000. Assuming that a patient was quarantined immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed, Q was equal to the confirmed number of cases. β is the daily transmission rate, defined as the expected number of infections caused by one infectious person per day. Once a susceptible (S) person becomes infected, the status is changed to exposed for an incubation period, 1/α. Theoretically, the patient is not infectious during the incubation period. After incubation, the patient experiences disease onset and becomes infectious (I). The time interval between disease onset to quarantine (Q) is the infectious time, 1/γ.\\nBecause the SEIQ model cannot be solved explicitly, β was estimated using the Monte carlo method, which simulated the two independent Poisson processes: daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time. To estimate β, there are two scenarios to consider. Firstly, the number of cases may only be available at the beginning and end of the study period. The examples used were the Diamond Princess Cruise and Wuhan prior to January 20 th when the diagnosis kit was not sufficiently available. In this scenario, β was estimated by Monte carlo approximation of the number of cases at the end of the targeted time period. Secondly, the number of Q is made available each day for the examples and the number of confirmed cases in China after January 20 th . In this scenario, γ was first determined from clinical reports for the targeted time period, and then β was estimated by minimizing the mean squared errors from 1,000 Monte carlo samples that approximated the Q curve.\\n.

The simulation was based on two independent Poisson processes: daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time. The daily means and 95% confidence intervals for Q were obtained over 1,000 Monte carlo runs.\\nEpidemiological analysis was performed on data collected from the Mainland of China between January 1 st and January 20 th , 2020. During this period, the suspected zoonotic source, the Huanan Seafood Market, was closed and travel restrictions were not yet enforced by the government. Based on the reported clinical analysis for the 425 cases prior to January 23 rd , the average inoculation time interval was found to be 5.2 days and the average time interval from disease onset to a clinical visit was 5.8 days . In this study, the total number of cases, 8247, including both confirmed and suspected patients, on January 26, 2020 were used as the number of onsets (I+E) for January 20 th , 2020. In the same way, the total number of cases reported between January 1 st and January 7 th , which totaled 136, was used as I0 in the SEIQ model. Because the SEIQ model cannot be solved explicitly, Monte carlo simulation was exploited to determine the daily transmission rate β0=0.44 with 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43 to 0.47 ( Figure 1A ). Given the mean time interval between onset and hospital quarantine of 12.5 days, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 5.5 (95% CI 5.3 to 5.8).\\n.

It is believed that an enclosed and crowded environment is favorable for coronavirus transmission, however the epidemiological data is lacking. To test the hypothesis, the recent Diamond Princess cruise epidemic was used as a comparable case study. A clear disease outbreak was reported on this cruise. A passenger, who visited China on January 10 th , was on board from January 20 th and January 25 th before being confirmed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. All people on board have been quarantined at sea since February 5 th and 621 out of 3711 people were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. As some of the patients were known to be infected after the quarantine, possibly due to central air conditioning and family infection, only the confirmed cases (n=135) by February 10 th (five days incubation plus one day diagnosis) were used for a conservative estimation of transmission. Using a SEIQ model while Q=0, the daily transmission rate, β, was found to be 1.04 (95% CI 0.69-1.87) ( Figure 1B ), which is twice as much as the transmission rate in open cities. Using the infection period of 12.5 days, the effective reproductive number on the cruise, Rc, was 13.0 (95% CI 8.63-23.375).\\nThe link between many of the December cases and the Huanan Seafood Market indicates that the Huanan Seafood Market is one of the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2, if not only.\\nAfter the forced shutdown of the Huanan Seafood Market on January 1 st , the effectiveness of the zoonotic infection and a potential secondary source of SARS-CoV-2 that continued to infect the Wuhan people remained in question.\\n.

The first SARS-CoV-2 onset was found on December 1 st 2019 (Huang et al., 2020) , and by the 1 st of January, 41 patients were confirmed and quarantined. Using the 5.8-day interval between disease onset and clinical visit, 136 cases diagnosed in the first 6 days of January were included, bringing the total number of infections to 177. Given β0=0.44, the development of the epidemic was simulated by initializing with a range of numbers (from 1 to 5) of infections on December 1 st using the SEIQ model. It showed that at most one infected patient can be allowed in the model, which induced a mean of 174 infections (95% CI 161-187) by January 1 st . Instead of one, if two unrelated people were infected by December 1 st , the 95% CI would be (291, 318) on January 1 st , significantly larger than the expected 177 cases. Thus, the transmission would be so minimal that it would not substantially contribute to the final number of infections, even if there existed a second zoonotic source. In the same sense, the results did not support a continuous zoonotic source within the Huanan Seafood Market, which would have resulted in a higher overall number of infections in the later trajectory.\\nAs an RNA virus, coronavirus conveys a high mutation rate (Benvenuto et al., 2020) , raising concerns whether the transmission would change between generations. The significantly higher mortality rate observed in Wuhan suggested that the transmission may attenuate over generations. To test this hypothesis, the patients infected in December 2019 were considered as the first generation because most of the cases had links to the Huanan Market, while the patients infected in January 2020 were considered the second-or-later generation. Given the data from December (assuming there is only one case at the beginning of December), β was estimated to be .

Furthermore, the transmission rates between Wuhan and other cities were also compared. Based on Guan et al's analysis of 1,099 patients confirmed by January 29 th , 616 were identified outside of Wuhan. Out of the 616 patients193 had recently visited Wuhan. Using a mean infectious period of 5 days, β was calculated to 0.438 (β=(616-193)/193/5=0.438), which was within the 95% confidence interval of the previous estimation of β0 in Wuhan, 0.44 (95% CI 0.43-0.47). Therefore, no evidence of attenuation of transmission was found.\\nUnprecedented measures were taken in Wuhan to stop the spread of COVID-19. Immediately after the official announcement of the novel coronavirus, home isolations and personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves were enforced. Public transportation was limited and, eventually, all canceled. On January 23 rd , the government suspended all plane, train and bus travel in and out of Wuhan. On February 2 nd , a comprehensive quarantine strategy was taken by the Chinese government. All home-isolated patients were mandated to be hospitalized in the newly built square cabin hospitals, and all people who had suspected symptoms or had close contacts were demanded for mandatory isolation in the quarantine stations. The effects of these steps may not be clear until the end of the epidemic. Nevertheless, an intermediate analysis is needed for evaluating various control strategies.\\nConsidering the one-day delay in the quarantine of the patients in the square cabin hospitals, the SEIQ model was used to fit the data into two phases, from January 23 rd to February 2 nd , and from February 3 rd to February 20 th . In the first phase, γ was chosen to be 1/6 based on the analysis by .

Using least squared errors for an exhaustive search of β, the optimal transmission rate became 0.54, which was greater than the basic transmission rate β0=0.44 ( Figure   2A ). In the second phase, the time interval from disease onset to quarantine was assumed to drop by another 50% due to the implication of the square cabin hospitals. Thus, γ=1/6, the transmission rate β decreased to 0.10, which was an 81.5% reduction from the first phase and a 77.3% reduction from the basic transmission rate. In conclusion, the aggressive quarantine strategy of building square cabin hospitals has effectively decreased the transmission, whereas the usefulness of the travel ban, home isolation, and personal protection is still unclear.\\nTo further investigate the timing of the comprehensive quarantine, given β=0.10 and γ=1/6, simulated isolations were employed to track the numbers of confirmed cases (Q) at various starting dates, January 1 st , 10 th , 20 th , and 30 th . The initial number of cases was estimated by the SEIQ model.\\nThe predicted Q value was plotted on a logarithm scale up to February 29 th ( Figure 2B) . It was noted that all curves tended to stabilize after the quarantine measures, and the time interval to stabilization increased as the number of initial cases increased. Beginning the quarantine on January 1 st , 136 initial cases were reported. Curve stabilization was achieved after about 10 days, with 235 cases reported at the end of this period. January 10 th started with approximately 1,250 cases and ended with 1,834 cases and January 20 th started with about 8,250 and ended with about 12,000. The January 30 th quarantine took almost 20 days to reach stabilization, and the final number of cases, 62,635, was nearly double the initial number of cases, 38,397. It was noted that the prediction was rather accurate as illustrated by the small 95% CI (gray area), and the CI decreased to negligible as the initial number of cases increased.\\n.

The basic reproductive number, R0, for SARS was determined to be 3 with 95% CI being 2 to 4 (Dye and Gay, 2003) . However, contrary to public knowledge, the earlier reports from the COVID-19 outbreak provided a R0 number less than or equal to that for SARS Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . This may have resulted from an inaccurate number of clinical cases due to delayed clinical visits, overloading of clinical resources, and a low sensitivity of the COVID-19 diagnosis kit. With more clinical reports published, the case numbers were adjusted based on the information presented, which gave a more accurate transmission estimation. The basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was then found to be 5.6, which is substantially higher than that for SARS.\\nIn an enclosed and crowded environment, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to significantly increase. The Diamond Princess Cruise provided an excellent case study as the development of COVID-19 on the cruise line has a clear infectious source, exposure time, quarantine time, and total number of infections. The transport of the virus through the central air conditioning system and the ineffective quarantine of the ship's crew, however, raised some concerns. Nevertheless, a conservative estimation of transmission using only 50% of the confirmed cases has proven the high transmission rate in an enclosed crowded ship. This suggested that the initial offense within the Huanan Seafood Market could be at a high level.\\nThe likely zoonotic origin also raised questions about additional sources other than the Huanan Seafood Market. This argument was partially supported by several early cases with no .

Rigorous statistical models were used to test the hypothesis of a second zoonotic source, and the development of case numbers did not support this hypothesis. Though our model cannot completely exclude the possibility of additional zoonotic sources, it suggested a minimal effect by such sources. Furthermore, the model did not support the constant zoonotic infection within Huanan Seafood Market throughout December. If the zoonotic transgression was sustained, a larger number of infected cases would have been observed. Based on the data from the Diamond Process Cruise, the transmission rate was higher in an enclosed and crowded place, like the Huanan Seafood Market. However, similar transmission rate was observed in December as in January. This is likely due to the market's daytime only operating hours, reducing the contact time. This result further suggested similar transmission rate between generations, which was confirmed by comparing the transmission in Wuhan and other cities. High mutation rates have been observed in the genome sequences collected from more than 100 human specimens. However, the effect that these mutations have on transmission may not be observed in such a short time period.\\nThe Chinese government took unprecedented measures to fight the new epidemic and those measures raised global controversy for their necessity and effectiveness. The restrictive travel ban and home isolation enforced in Wuhan was expected to largely decrease the transmission and prevent further spread of the disease within weeks. Nevertheless, the coronavirus infection was continuously increasing exponentially in late January and early February in Wuhan. In this model, an increase in the transmission rate (from 0.44 to 0.54) was observed during this time period. It suggested that the travel ban and home isolation cannot effectively prevent the disease spread. This was likely due to the probable cross-contamination in the long waiting lines at the .

The limited medical resources only allowed patients with severe symptoms to be hospitalized. A low sensitivity of diagnosis further increased the waiting time for a confirmed case. Insufficient hospital beds resulted in a large number of home isolated patients, often leading to family infection. Observing the tremendous epidemic, the Chinese government built square cabin hospitals with more than twenty thousand beds and quickly moved all patients into these hospitals. All people with suspected symptoms or with close patient contacts were isolated in the government-managed quarantine stations. This comprehensive quarantine method has successfully reduced the transmission rate by 81.5%, and also greatly shortened the infectious time interval. The analysis in this study showed that the epidemic can be controlled within a few weeks if the comprehensive quarantine was conducted on January 20 th or earlier. Concurrently with the development of this manuscript, it was reported that South Korea had more than 1,000 home isolations in the city of Daegu for a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is highly recommended that other countries immediately quarantine all suspected patients.\\nThis model was developed using the cases up to February 20 th . As the case numbers increase, the transmission features may change and some of the assumptions, such as the infectious period, may vary. The cases reported in Wuhan were known to be less than the actual number in January due to overloading of clinical resources and the low sensitivity of diagnosis.\\nThis study attempted to overcome these limitations by using the clinical information verified by several reports and relying only on the beginning and ending cases. Therefore, this model tended to reflect the real trend of this critical epidemic and it provides more convincing evidence to guide the control of this disease by the government.\\n.

       "2  early April by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario, that no further actions are implemented, the spread of COVID-19 is expected to continue slowly, reaching 21,000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed cases, deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days; a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Year's celebration, Farvardin, first month of spring (30 th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the number of reported deaths of COVDI-19 to be between 3,000-5,000 and the number of recovered cases between 5,000 -30,000 from the total confirmed cases in the range of 35,000-70,000 infected cases.\\nConclusions: The Modeling of Covid-19 outbreak shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition, many factors are effective in stopping the disease.

WHO reported that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and chosen by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January. (1) During the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom (2) . As of 17 March 2020, according to Iranian health authorities, there had been 988 COVID-19 deaths in Iran with more than 16,000 confirmed infections(3,4,5) This respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus is one of the leading causes for serious illnesses in people all over the world. According to the global statistics of fatalities caused by coronavirus, and its spread in Iran, it is vital and essential to forecast its outbreak by a model. As the outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), is a worldwide pandemic, it is rapidly expanding in Iran, real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. Previously, real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility, severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak, such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola. Analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters, such as the incubation and infectious periods, and delays between infection and detection, isolation, and reporting of cases. However, official individual patient data rarely become publicly available, when the information is most needed. This is an analysis of the COVID-19 out-break in Iran. In this population-level observational study, I used the Iranian Ministry of Health reports downloaded from GitHub, an online data-sharing platform. This dataset is updated on a daily basis with a 24 hour delay. The dataset includes time-stamped counts of the daily cases and deaths within each province in Iran.\\nIn this study, we will build a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. I will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases, deaths and recovered for the whole country.\\n.

This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree -more recent values are given a greater weight.\\nDue to the lack of historical data, seasonality analysis has been removed from the modeling and the trends are analyzed based on the daily timeframe. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season. The trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time.\\nThe predictive model will be tested against four regression model evaluations for robustness. They are as follow:\\n• MAE -mean absolute error, this gives less weight to the outliers • MAPE -similar to MSE, but normalized by true observation. The downside is when the true observation is zero, this metric could be problematic.\\n• MSE -mean squared error, it is like a combination measurement of bias ad variance of the prediction. For example, bias squared add variance. .

The purpose of this test is to see how well the model fits the dataset without over-fitting it. The AIC score rewards models that achieve a high goodness-of-fit score ad penalizes them if they become over complex. A low AIC score indicates a better fit.\\nSince the outbreak has begun in early February 2020, the rate of infection and number of deaths has been increased significantly as seen in the illustration below. On the 19 th February, the first 2 deaths were reported, on the 23 rd February, 4 other provinces reported COVID-19 deaths, and within the space 28 days the virus has spreaded across the whole country (see illustration 2), by 20 th March 2020, Tehran, the capital city of Iran reported approximately to 4000 confirmed cases of COVID-19.\\n.

The top 10 most affected provinces are Tehran, Esfahan, Mazandaran, Qom, Alborz, Gilan, Markazi, Razavi-Khorasan, East Azerbaijan and Semon, which can be reviewed in illustration 3, province ranked by confirmed cases from the highest number to the least.\\n.

If no control measures are put in place, it is expected that over 40,000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However, if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success, one would expect the spread of the COV-19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario, that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID-19 to continue on a gentle incline, reaching 21,000 by mid-June.\\n.

The base model shown in Illustration 5 is the simple forecast model, without trend or seasonality built-in. It has the highest AIC out of the three models across the 5 sampled provinces, although it has a low MAPE, when compared to the other three statistical metrics like RMSE, MAE, MASE it yields the highest margin of error in the group.\\nThe quality of the predictive model for Tehran is acceptable because the dataset is more robust compared to one integrated with seasonality. The Mean Absolute Scaled Error, MASE is less than 1 for the projected 90 days period which is a positive score for the model. The RMSE, unbiased forecast score is slightly higher than the MAE, which gives a median future distribution of 84. The MAPE is over 100% which means the errors are \"much greater\" then the actual values.

       "3  All dynamic processes that take place on DNA in the nucleus occur in the context of a chromatin landscape that comprises nucleosomes and their modifications, transcription factors and chromatin-associated complexes. A variety of chromatin features mark sites of transcriptional regulatory elements and regions of activation and silencing that differ between cell types and change during development and disease progression. The mapping of chromatin features genome-wide has traditionally been performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), in which chromatin is cross-linked and solubilized and an antibody to a protein or modification of interest is used to immunoprecipitate the bound DNA (Rodriguez-Ubreva and Ballestar, 2014) . However, alternative chromatin profiling methods based on enzyme tethering in situ have recently gained in popularity.\\nFor example, in Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) (Skene and Henikoff, 2017) , which is based on Laemmli's Chromatin Immunocleavage (ChIC) method (Schmid et al., 2004) , a fusion protein between Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) and Protein A binds sites of antibody binding in nuclei or permeabilized cells bound to magnetic beads. Activation of MNase with Ca ++ results in targeted cleavage releasing the antibody-bound fragment into the supernatant for paired-end DNA sequencing. The low backgrounds resulting from antibody-tethered cleavage and release reduce cell numbers and sequencing depths required to map chromatin features relative to ChIP-seq, and CUT&RUN is now becoming a standard tool for mapping transcription factors and other chromatin features (Hainer et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Oomen et al., 2019; Roth et al., 2018) .\\nMore recently, we substituted the Tn5 transposase for MNase in a modified CUT&RUN protocol, such that addition of Mg ++ results in a cut-and-paste \"tagmentation\" reaction, in which sequencing adapters are integrated around sites of antibody binding (Kaya-Okur et al., 2019) . In CUT&Tag, DNA purification is followed by PCR amplification, eliminating the end-polishing and ligation steps required for sequencing library preparation in CUT&RUN. Like CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag requires relatively little input material, and the low backgrounds permit low sequencing depths to sensitively map chromatin features. Because integrated pA-Tn5 is not released following the tagmentation reaction, CUT&Tag and related methods are suitable for single-cell profiling, in which all steps through tagmentation are performed in a single in situ reaction, after which single cells or nuclei are dispensed for barcoding PCR amplification.\\nThe major practical advantage of CUT&Tag over other methods is that it eliminates the time and expense of preparing sequencing libraries, but CUT&Tag also has other important advantages that may make it the protocol of choice for most chromatin profiling applications. CUT&Tag has improved signal-to-noise for histone marks, at least in part because an antibody-tethered Tn5 integrates its mosaic-end adapters and remains bound during the incubation (Kaya-Okur et al., 2019) . We also found that CUT&Tag is somewhat more efficient than CUT&RUN, likely because integration by targeted Tn5 is more efficient than enzymatic end-polishing and ligation in traditional library preparation steps.\\nHere we describe an at-home version of CUT&Tag in which all steps from mixing of native or lightly cross-linked nuclei with magnetic beads to post-PCR purification are performed in a single tube. This simplification of CUT&Tag requires only pipettors, a mini-centrifuge, a tube rotator, a PCR machine and disposable pipette tips, tubes and reagents to produce high-quality genome chromatin profiling data. During the COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions in Seattle we performed CUT&Tag@home for 16-32 samples per day with uniformly high quality for chromatin marks of active regulatory elements, gene bodies, Polycomb-silenced regions and constitutive heterochromatin. The low cell number requirements and read depths of CUT&Tag@home enable home-bound researchers to produce ready-for-sequencing barcoded libraries with relatively little technical expertise, effort or cost.\\nThe basic CUT&Tag method is schematized in Figure 1 . Our simplified protocol applies to any chromatin feature for which an antibody is available and should be adaptable to any cell type for which there is a standard nuclei isolation protocol. In brief, native or lightly cross-linked nuclei are prepared and immobilized on magnetic beads. Beads are incubated with a primary antibody followed by incubation with a secondary antibody to increase the number of IgG molecules at each epitope bound by the primary antibody. Beads are washed and incubated with protein A-Tn5 loaded with mosaic-end adapters and washed under stringent conditions. Tn5 is activated by addition of Mg 2+ , a \"one-and-done\" reaction in that the pA-Tn5 transposome is not active once it integrates its adapters. DNA is released in a small volume of SDS and then mixed with Triton-X100 to neutralize the SDS. Samples are enriched by PCR amplification and a single Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) magnetic bead cleanup step. Up to 48 barcoded libraries from multiple experiments may be pooled for each lane of a 2-lane flow cell, as 3 million mapped paired-end reads are usually sufficient for a genome-wide profile of a histone modification in human cells. CUT&Tag@home is performed on frozen nuclei using non-toxic materials, and has minimal equipment requirements, so that it can be conveniently performed in a utility area on ~1.5 meters of counter space (Figure 2) .\\nThe CUT&Tag@home protocol is also available from Protocols.io (https://www.protocols.io/view/cut-amptag-home-bd26i8he), where users can Added antibody (green) binds to the target chromatin protein (blue) between nucleosomes (gray ovals) in the genome, and the excess is washed away. A second antibody (orange) is added and enhances tethering of pA-Tn5 transposome (gray boxes) at antibody-bound sites. After washing away excess transposome, addition of Mg++ activates the transposome and integrates adapters (red) at chromatin protein binding sites. Genomic fragments with adapters at both ends are released and enriched by PCR. b) CUT&Tag is performed on a solid support. Unfixed cells or nuclei (blue) are permeabilized and mixed with antibody to a target chromatin protein. After addition and binding of cells to Concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads (M), all further steps are performed in the same reaction tube with magnetic capture between washes and incubations, including pA-Tn5 tethering, integration, and DNA purification.

Steps 1-8 for all experiments were performed on this counter in a home laundry/utility room using stock solutions and frozen nuclei aliquots previously prepared in the lab. There are no hazardous materials or dangerous equipment used in this protocol, however appropriate lab safety training is recommended. \\n• Binding buffer: Mix 200 μL 1M HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 100 μL 1M KCl, 10 μL 1M CaCl 2 and 10 μL 1M MnCl 2 , and bring the final volume to 10 mL with dH 2 O. Store the buffer at 4°C for up to several months. • Wash buffer: Mix 1 mL 1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5 mL 5 M NaCl, 12.5 μL 2 M spermidine, bring the final volume to 50 mL with dH 2 O, and add 1 Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor EDTA-Free tablet. Store the buffer at 4°C for up to several months. \\n• Resuspend and withdraw enough of the ConA bead slurry such that there will be 3-5 μL for each final sample of up to ~100,000 mammalian cells. The following is for 16 samples. • Transfer 85 μL ConA bead slurry into 1 mL Binding buffer in a 1.5 mL tube and mix by pipetting. Place the tube on a magnet stand to clear (30 s to 2 min). • Withdraw the liquid completely, and remove from the magnet stand.

Tip: For bulk processing, resuspend in Antibody buffer containing antibody (1:100) with gentle vortexing. Tip: We use 1:100 by default or the manufacturer's recommended concentration for immunofluorescence. • Place on a Rotator at room temperature and incubate 1-2 hr. In the lab, a nuclei prep was split and prepared as either native (Nat) or cross-linked (XL), then aliquoted and frozen. At home, aliquots were thawed and libraries were prepared from 50,000 starting cells using this protocol with the following rabbit antibodies: H3K4me1-Th (Thermo #710795 lot 1998633); H3K4me1-Ep (Epicypher 13-0026 lot 28344001); H3K4me2-Mi (Millipore 07-030 lot 3229364); H3K4me2-Ep (Epicypher 13-0027); H3K4me3-Ac (Active Motif 39159 lot 22118006); H3K36me3-Ep (Epicypher Rabbit monoclonal #13-0031, lot 18344001); H3K9me3-Ab (Abcam ab8898 lot GR3302452-1); H3K27me3-Cs (CST #9733).

Tip: To evaluate success of the procedure without requiring library preparation, include in parallel a positive control antibody (e.g.α-H3K27me3), and an optional negative control by omitting the primary antibody.\\n• Place tubes on the magnet stand to clear. Withdraw the liquid with the pipettor set to 5 µL less than the volume to be removed. • Mix the secondary antibody 1:100 in Wash buffer and squirt in 50 µL per sample while gently vortexing to allow the solution to dislodge the beads from the sides. Tip: Although not needed for CUT&RUN, the secondary antibody step is required for CUT&Tag to increase the number of Protein A binding sites for each bound antibody. We have found that without the secondary antibody the efficiency is very low. • Place the tubes on a Rotator and rotate at room temperature for 30 min.\\n• After a quick spin (<500 x g), place the tubes on a magnet stand to clear and withdraw the liquid with the pipettor set to 5 µL less than the volume to be removed. • After a quick spin, replace on the magnet stand and withdraw the last drop with a 20 µL pipette tip. • With the tubes still on the magnet stand, carefully add 500 µL Wash buffer. The surface tension will cause the beads to slide up along the side of the tube closest to the magnet. • Slowly withdraw the liquid with a 1 mL pipette tip without disturbing the beads.\\nTip: To withdraw the liquid, set the pipettor to 600 µL, and keep the plunger depressed while lowering the tip to the bottom. The liquid level will rise to near the top completing the wash. Then ease off on the plunger until all the liquid is withdrawn, and remove the pipettor. This will leave behind at most a small drop of liquid. • After a quick spin, place the tubes on a magnet stand to remove the last drop with a 20 µL pipettor and proceed immediately to the next section.\\n• Mix pA-Tn5 adapter complex in 300-wash buffer to a final concentration of 1:200. Tip: pA-Tn5 aliquots received from the CUT&RUN team are pre-loaded with adapters suitable for single-or dual-indexing on a paired-end Illumina flowcell platform. • Squirt in 50 µL per sample of the pA-Tn5 mix while vortexing and invert by rotation to allow the solution to dislodge most or all of the beads. Tip: When using the recommended Macsimag magnet stand, dislodging the beads can be done by removing the plexiglass tube holder from the magnet, and with fingers on top to prevent the tubes from opening up or falling out, invert by rotating sharply a few times. • After a quick spin (<500 x g), place the tubes on a Rotator at room temperature for 1 hr.\\n.

Tip: Twirling the tube back and forth rapidly between thumb and finger will effectively wet the sides of the tube, followed by a quick spin to bring most of the beads to the bottom. • Incubate at 58 ºC for 1 hr in a PCR cycler with heated lid to reverse the crosslinks and release pA-Tn5 from the tagmented DNA.\\n• To the PCR tube containing the bead slurry add 15 µL 0.67% Triton neutralization solution + 2 µL of 10 µM Universal or barcoded i5 primer + 2 µL of 10 µM uniquely barcoded i7 primers, using a different barcode for each sample. Vortex on full and place tubes in metal tube holder on ice. Tip: Indexed primers are described by Buenrostro, J.D. et al. Single-cell chromatin accessibility reveals principles of regulatory variation. Nature 523:486 (2015). Do not use Nextera or NEB primers. • Add 25 µL NEBnext (non-hot-start), vortex to mix, followed by a quick spin.\\n• Mix, quick spin and place in Thermocycler and begin cycling program with heated lid:\\n.

Tip: The cycle times are based on using a conventional Peltier cycler (e.g., BioRad/MJ PTC200), in which the ramping times (3°C/sec) are sufficient for annealing to occur as the sample cools from 98°C to 60°C. Therefore, the use of a rapid cycler with a higher ramping rate will require either reducing the ramping time or other adjustments to assure annealing.\\nTip: Do not add extra PCR cycles to see a signal by capillary gel electrophoresis (e.g. Tapestation). If there is no nucleosomal ladder for the H3K27me3 positive control, you may assume that CUT&Tag failed, but observing no signal for a sparse chromatin protein such as a transcription factor is normal, and the barcoded sample can be concentrated for mixing with the pool of barcoded samples for sequencing. Extra PCR cycles reduce the complexity of the library and may result in an unacceptable level of PCR duplicates.\\n• After tubes have cooled, remove from the cycler and add 1.3 volume (65 µL) SPRI bead slurry, mixing by pipetting up and down. • Quick spin and let sit at room temperature 5-10 min.\\n• Place on magnet 5 min to allow the beads to clear before withdrawing the liquid.\\nWhile still on the magnet stand add 200 µL 80% ethanol. • Withdraw the liquid with a pipette to the bottom of the tube, and add 200 µL 80% ethanol. • Withdraw the liquid and after a quick spin, remove the remaining liquid with a 20 µL pipette. Do not air-dry the beads, but proceed immediately to the next step. • Remove from the magnet stand, add 22 µL 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and vortex on full.

For maximum economy, paired-end PE25 is more than sufficient for mapping to large genomes. • Using paired-end 25x25 sequencing on a HiSeq 2-lane rapid run flow cell we obtain ~300 million total mapped reads, or ~3 million per sample when there are 96 samples mixed to obtain approximately equal molarity.\\n• We align paired-end reads to hg19 using Bowtie2 version 2.3.4.3 with options: -end-to-end --very-sensitive --no-unal --no-mixed --no-discordant --phred33 -I 10 -X 700. For mapping E. coli carry-over fragments, we also use the --no-overlap -no-dovetail options to avoid possible cross-mapping of the experimental genome to that of the carry-over E. coli DNA that is used for calibration. • Tracks are made as bedgraph files of normalized counts, which are the fraction of total counts at each basepair scaled by the size of the hg19 genome. • To calibrate samples in a series for samples done in parallel using the same antibody we use counts of E. coli fragments carried over with the pA-Tn5 the same as one would for an ordinary spike-in. Our sample script (https://github.com/Henikoff/Cut-and-Run/blob/master/spike_in_calibration.csh) can be used to calibrate based on either a spike-in or E. coli carry-over DNA. • Most data analysis tools used for ChIP-seq data, such as bedtools (https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Picard (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and deepTools (https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/), can be used on CUT&Tag data. • Analysis tools designed specifically for CUT&RUN/Tag data include the SEACR peak caller (Meers et al., 2019) also available as a public web server (https://seacr.fredhutch.org), CUT&RUNTools (Zhu et al., 2019) and henipipe (https://github.com/scfurl/henipipe).\\nWe have developed a streamlined version of CUT&Tag that eliminates DNA extraction, so that all steps can be performed in a single PCR tube (Kaya-Okur et al., 2020) . CUT&Tag@home uses the same protocol, which allowed for a direct comparison of inlab to at-home implementation. To ascertain the ability of this CUT&Tag direct-to-PCR protocol to produce DNA sequencing libraries in our home laundry/utility room, we used frozen aliquots of native human K562 cell nuclei prepared in the laboratory and profiled there using the streamlined single-tube protocol. Aliquots of nuclei were thawed and serially diluted in Wash buffer from ~60,000 down to ~60 starting cells, where the average yield of nuclei was ~50%. We used antibodies to H3K27me3, which marks nucleosomes within broad domains of Polycomb-dependent silencing, and H3K4me3, which preferentially marks nucleosomes immediately downstream of active promoters. Aliquots of nuclei were taken home and stored in our kitchen freezer, then thawed and diluted at home, and profiled for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. In both the laboratory and at home we performed all steps in groups of 16 or 32 samples over the course of a single day, treating all samples the same regardless of cell numbers. Whether produced at home or in the . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

A total of 160 CUT&Tag@home libraries were sequenced by the Fred Hutch Genomics Shared Resource on three two-lane PE25 Illumina flow-cells runs for an estimated cost of ~$50 per sample for materials and sequencing.\\nExamples of Tapestation profiles of libraries produced at home detects nucleosomal ladders down to 200 cells for H3K27me3 and nucleosomeal and subnucleosomal fragments for H3K4me3 (Fig.  4) . Sequenced fragments were aligned to the human genome using bowtie2 and tracks were displayed using IGV. Similar results were obtained for both athome and in-lab profiles for both histone modifications (Fig. 5) using pA-Tn5 produced in the laboratory, and results using a commercial Protein A/G-Tn5 were at least as good. However, the results for 60 starting cells were sparser than our published results for H3K27me3 using permeabilized cells with Proteinase K digestion and SPRI bead extraction of tagmented DNA. The lower yields using the singletube nuclei protocol could be due to losses during the nuclei preparation and/or reduction in efficiency during PCR in situ or other differences between the protocols.\\nTo illustrate the utility of our simple chromatin profiling approach, we chose antibodies to one dimethylated and four tri-methylated lysines on the Nterminal tail of Histone H3 that mark distinct chromatin features genome-wide. H3K4me3 preferentially marks nucleosomes immediately downstream of gene promoters and H3K4me2 also marks enhancers, H3K36me3 marks gene bodies, H3K27me3 marks regions of Polycomb developmental silencing (facultative heterochromatin) and H3K9me3 marks regions of constitutive heterochromatin. A representative region is shown (Figure 6) , with selected comparisons to illustrate specific chromatin features. A comparison between H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 shows the active housekeeping STRIP2 promoter marked by H3K4me3 and an enhancer just downstream marked by both modifications. These functional inferences are supported by an ATACseq track, which shows that both sites are accessible to Tn5 and by SuRE (Survey of Regulatory Elements), a massively parallel reporter survey for autonomous active regulatory elements in K562 cells (van Arensbergen et al., 2017) . Further downstream the STRIP2 gene body is heavily marked by H3K36me3, in contrast to the NRF1 gene The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.043083 doi: bioRxiv preprint encoding a transcription factor, where there is strong H3K4 di-and tri-methylation, but very little gene-body H3K36me3. This example illustrates the rich gene regulatory information that can be obtained by CUT&Tag.\\nTo extend these observations to a genomic scale, we aligned the four H3 lysine trimethylation datasets to transcriptional start sites and produced heatmaps ordered by signal intensity over ±10 kb intervals. As expected, the H3K4me3 peak lies just downstream of the promoter, showing very little overlap with H3K36me3, confirmed by average plots of these marks normalized to the genome (Fig. 7a) .\\nA comparison between H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 CUT&Tag tracks suggests that these two silencing marks are non-overlapping (Fig. 6) . Interestingly, in the highlighted example, a strong peak of H3K9me3 is seen to correspond to an ERV-1 family Figure 3 were sequenced and tracks for a representative region were compared to an ENCODE dataset (GSM788088), to datasets produced using the original extraction protocol, and this single-tube protocol performed in the lab.

To ascertain the generality of the observation, we extracted 20-kb segments centered over the middle of each ERV from the H3 lysine trimethylation tracks over Chromosome 1, which harbors 50,707 of the 695,067 human ERVs, from the UCSC Repeat Masker file. We stacked the segments ordered by decreasing length of the ERV (Fig. 7b) . For H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 we observed essentially no signal over these elements, whereas for H3K9me3 we observed signal over elements of all sizes, including a cluster of heavily H3K9me3-marked ERV fragments spanning ~2 kb in length. This observation is consistent with studies showing that intact and active ERVs are among the most heavily H3K9me3-methylated elements in mammalian genomes (Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014; Ohtani et al., 2018; Walter et al., 2016) . To determine whether there are any differences among the ERV families in the propensity for gaining H3K9 trimethylation, we performed unsupervised k-means clustering over a ±1 kb span on the full set of Chromosome 1 ERVs (k=3). Cluster I comprises 5,536 heavily H3K9trimethylated ERVs (11%) and Cluster III comprises 31,177 ERVs (62%) with background levels of H3K9 trimethylation (Fig 7b, rightmost panel) . Among the ERV families, ERVK, which accounts for 8% of the total human ERVs, was on average 2.8-fold more highly represented in Cluster I relative to Cluster III (186:382) than were all other ERVs (5350:30795). The ERVK family is the youngest and most intact of the human endogenous retrovirus families (Hanke et al., 2016) , and in the mouse male germline, members of the ERVK family were specifically reactivated upon loss of a germline- Figure 6 : CUT&Tag@home segments the human epigenome with four H3 lysine trimethylation marks: Screenshot of a representative 1 Mb region of the human genome showing CUT&Tag@home profiles for histone H3 lysine-4 methylation of constitutive heterochromatin (K9me3), Polycomb-dependent silenced domains (K27me3) transcribed gene bodies (K36me3), promoters (K4me3), promoters and enhancers (K4me2) and accessible DNA (ATAC-seq, GSM269550). Two regions are expanded to illustrate the predominantly mutual exclusivity of the tri-methylation marks, also showing two SuRE autonomous regulatory elements annotated as an enhancer (above) and promoter (below). An ERV-1 retrotransposon is heavily marked by H3K9me3.

Thus the enrichment of ERVK in the heavily H3K9-trimethylated class is consistent with a role for this modification in maintaining genome integrity by suppression of endogenous retroviral proliferation.\\nWe conclude that five CUT&Tag@home histone H3 methylation profiles segment the human genome at high-resolution into active promoters, enhancers, gene bodies, developmentally silenced domains and constitutively silenced endogenous retroviruses. Whereas chromatin accessibility profiling maps only enhancers and promoters without distinguishing between them (e.g. the ATAC-seq track in Figure 5 ), CUT&Tag using histone methylation antibodies captures the extraordinary richness of the full epigenome.\\nWe previously introduced CUT&Tag for efficient low-cost genome-wide chromatin profiling and showed that it provides high-resolution profiles for epitopes on nucleosomes, transcription factors and RNA Polymerase II with especially low signal-to-noise Fig. 7 : H3 lysine trimethylation data aligned to TSSs and ERVs. a) Heatmaps ordered by normalized counts (the scaled fraction of total counts at each basepair) and average plots showing that these four H3 tail trimethylations are mostly non-overlapping genome-wide when aligned around transcriptional start sites (TSSs). b) Heatmaps of the four H3 tail trimethylations aligned around the midpoints of the 50,707 annotated ERV elements on human Chromosome 1 and ordered top-to-bottom by decreasing element size. For clarity, the top segment of the H3K9me3 panel is expanded in the panel to the right to reveal a cluster of ~2-kb elements. K-means clustering of the 2-kb region centered around the midpoints all Chromosome 1 ERV elements separated the ERVs into a heavily H3K9trimethylated Cluster I (11%), a weakly H3K9-trimethylated Cluster II (27%) and Cluster III with background levels of H3K9 trimethylation (62%).

We showed that CUT&Tag is highly versatile not only in the range of chromatin features it can profile, but also in the read-out platforms it is suitable for, including in plate format for low-cell-number samples and nanowell dispensing for on the order of 1000 single cells. Since our original CUT&Tag publication in April, 2019, we have distributed >600 pA-Tn5 aliquots to laboratories around the world, and during that time our original protocol has been the most popular of the ~6000 protocols on Protocols.io (Lenny Teytelman, personal communication). Because CUT&Tag requires that cells or nuclei remain intact throughout the procedure, there are no harsh treatments or toxic chemicals required, which makes the protocol inherently safe and appropriate for being performed in a home utility area. Therefore, we expect that CUT&Tag@home will be welcomed by a substantial cohort of users, whether they are able to work in the lab or can only work at home subject to COVID-19 restrictions.\\nCUT&Tag@home implements a streamlined version of the bench-top protocol that allows for chromatin profiling without tube transfers from nuclei to purified sequencing-ready barcoded libraries (Kaya-Okur et al., 2020) . Elimination of the DNA purification steps of CUT&Tag allows all operations from mixing of nuclei with magnetic beads to final library purification to be performed entirely by successive treatments of bead-bound nuclei in a single PCR tube. This protocol can be performed on as many as 32 samples in a single day with starting cell numbers ranging from <100 to ~100,000. We have extended the versatility of this streamlined CUT&Tag protocol by demonstrating that it can be performed with minor equipment, reagent and supply needs using materials borrowed from the lab or purchased online and delivered. This enables researchers, students and others with little hands-on laboratory experience to perform chromatin profiling at home. Although we do not expect that quantification, quality control and pooling of barcoded samples and sequencing to be also done at home, these services are likely to be available at many commercial and academic facilities, even during the COVID-19 crisis. In the longer term, we expect that the simplicity of our CUT&Tag@home protocol makes it just as suitable for the lab bench as it is for the laundry room.\\nEpicypher 13-0027; H3K4me3: Active Motif 39159; H3K36me3: Thermo MAS-24687 and Epicypher 13-0031; H3K9me3: Abcam ab8898; H3K27me3: CST #9733; Guinea pig antirabbit secondary: Antibodies Online AbIN101961.\\n   \n",
       "4  The world is facing an unprecedented health crisis affecting nearly all parts of society. In these times, access to the most state-of-the-art scientific knowledge is paramount to tackling the crisis. Academic journals and scholarly publishers are hence called upon to make new knowledge openly available and deliver new insights quickly.\\nIn the current Covid-19 era, it is clear that new knowledge is direly needed. Scientists all over the world have stepped in to do experiments, observational studies and new analyses as to obtain relevant information. However fast we would like to have access to this information, the scientific method used to obtain it, requires time. Drug trials and vaccine creations do not happen overnight (Thorp, 2020) . However, once such information has been gathered, it needs to be disseminated to all those potentially in the position to use it, as quick as possible. Traditionally, scholarly journals have been one of the main outlets to facilitate this (Horbach & Halffman, 2018) .\\nOne of the factors hindering quick delivery of new information through scholarly journals is the duration of their publication process. Through editorial assessment and peer review, journals select which articles deserve to be published on their pages, ideally filtering out invalid, erroneous or otherwise problematic research. Even though celebrated as being one of the hallmarks of science, the editorial process is also regularly criticized. Commentators blame it for being inconsistent (Peters & Ceci, 1982) , essentially flawed (Smith, 2006) , biased (Teplitskiy, Acuna, Elamrani-Raoult, Körding, & Evans, 2018) , andparticularly relevant in these times of crisis -slow (Nguyen et al., 2015) .\\nSeveral studies have previously aimed to assess the typical duration of journals' publication process (Lin, Hou, & Wu, 2016; Tosi, 2009 ). In their analyses, researchers commonly distinguish two stages of this process: the review stage (i.e. the stage between article submission and formal acceptance) and the editorial stage (i.e. the stage between acceptance and final publication, either online or in print). In a meta-analysis including over 2700 journal articles, Björk and Solomon (2013) find considerable differences in turnaround times (i.e. the period between submission and publication of a journal article, sometimes also called 'publication delays') between research disciplines. For biomedical journals, they find an average duration of the review stage of just over four months, while the editorial stage takes on average about five months. Clearly, such turnaround times are highly undesirable in light of the current health crisis.\\nTwo major responses to circumvent long turnaround times can currently be witnessed. From an author perspective, commentators are reporting a sharp increase in the use of preprint servers. On these online platforms, authors upload their manuscript, making it publicly accessible immediately upon finalization of the text (Gunnarsdottir, 2005) . Because no review, editorial assessment or copyediting takes place, manuscripts can be made accessible without publication delay. However, as manuscripts are only reviewed once they are available for anybody to read and use, scholars warn for potentially incorrect results spreading without editorial assessment filtering them. In fact, several cases of invalid research regarding Covid-19 being published as preprints have already been reported (Heimstädt, 2020; Marcus & Oransky, 2020) . It should be noted though that this is not specific to preprints, as journal articles can require from post-publication corrections and retractions as well (Horbach & Halffman, 2019) . Several articles related to Covid-19 have already gone through this process (Gautret et al., 2020) .\\nFrom the publishers' side, several journals and publishers are currently modifying their editorial procedures and policies to warrant fast dissemination of relevant information. For instance, eLife announced it would curtail requests for additional experiments during revisions, suspend its deadline for submitting revisions, make the posting of preprints to bioRxiv or medRxiv the default for all eLife submissions, and it would specifically mobilize early-career researchers to become reviewing editors and reviewers in order to extent the journal's reviewer pool (Eisen, Akhmanova, Behrens, & Weigel, 2020) . Similarly, Nature put out an open invitation to researchers with relevant expertise to review Covid-19 related papers over short time (\"Coronavirus pandemic: Nature's pledge to you,\" 2020). Hence, journals and publishers are aiming to attract reviewers that can assist in the rapid publication of new findings, relevant to tackle the health crisis. The Medical Journal of Australia (MJA) has drafted policies related to both preprints are rapid peer review, setting up 'fast lanes' for Covid-19 related research:\\n\"The MJA has stepped up to play its part in meeting this crisis, including ultra-rapid review of SARS-CoV-2 manuscripts and pre-print publication of unedited papers, to ensure that the newest data and viewpoints are available as soon as possible.\" (Talley, 2020) The Royal Society Open Publishing announced to establish a similar fast lane for their registered reports on Covid-19 related content. They have even gathered a group of 700 reviewers who have committed to review a paper in 24 to 48 hours when called up on (Brock, 2020) . The journal also acknowledges one of the major concerns related to these fast dissemination models: \"The ultra-rapid review and publication model entails a risk of error, but sharing important information too slowly is a much greater hazard.\" (Talley, 2020) In this article, we assess whether the scholarly publishing community succeeds in speeding up the dissemination of Covid-19 related content. To do so, we assess the use of preprint servers, the uptake of preprint articles in academic journals, and the duration of journals' publication process both prior to and during the present pandemic.\\nFor our analysis, we use a repository of Covid-19 related research articles established by the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS). The repository is based on databases of CORD19, Dimensions and the World Health Organisation (WHO), and includes articles on Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related (corona) viruses and infectious diseases. In particular, this means that the database contains journal articles and preprints that predate the current Covid-19 pandemic, as it for instance also includes articles on the 2002 SARS virus and disease. For brevity's sake, all such articles will in the remainder of this article by described as 'Covid-19 related' articles. A full description of the database as well as access to all relevant data is available (CWTS, 2020). Colavizza et al. (2020) provide a description and analysis of parts of this database. All results in this article are based on the April 4 release of the database. We note that the majority of articles in the dataset originates from the CORD19 database. Some doubt has been raised about the relevance of some of this database's articles to the current pandemic (Colavizza et al., 2020) , but for our purposes, the scope of the database seems reasonable. Based on this dataset, several analyses were performed:\\nWe analysed the duration of the publication process, in number of days, for a sample of 529 journal articles. 259 articles were published during the present pandemic (i.e. from Jan 1, 2020) and 270 were published prior to the pandemic (i.e. before Oct 1, 2019). The articles were published in 14 different journals. Journals were selected based on their number of articles both prior to and during the current pandemic as well as the availability of data on when articles were submitted, accepted and published. We selected the ten journals publishing most Covid-19 related articles in general, supplemented by the five journals publishing most Covid-19 related content since the start of the pandemic, that make publication data (submission, acceptance and publish) available. One journal, Viruses, matches both criteria. The list of journals used in this analysis, including their number of articles, as well as the journals discarded because no data on submission, acceptance or publication dates was available, is added as supplementary material A. From those journals, we sampled all articles published since the start of the pandemic and matched those to an equal number of articles published in the same journal prior to the pandemic to form a control group. In case the control group had fewer articles, we used this number of articles and only selected the most recent articles after the pandemic. In case less than ten articles were published since the start of the pandemic, we nonetheless sampled ten articles for the control group. For the control group, we sampled articles starting with publications in 2019 (but before Oct 1 st ) and moving backwards, in order to make sure editorial policies most closely resemble those in the pandemic. Table 1 presents the list of journals used, including the number of articles sampled per journal. Information on the dates of submission, acceptance and publication was manually retrieved from the journal's webpage. In case journals distinguished between publication online and appearance in the print issue of the journal, we selected the date of online publication.\\nTo control for potential effects specific to Covid-19 related papers, we selected, for all journals in our sample, the ten most recently published articles (as of April 16 th , 2020) about non-Covid-19 related content. In particular, these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning Covid-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or Cov-19 in their title, keywords and abstract. All the 140 articles in this control group were published during the current pandemic, with 64% published in April 2020, 32% in March, 1% in February, and 3% in January.\\nWe assessed the usage of preprint servers as a fast way of disseminating academic knowledge by counting the number of preprints on Covid-19 related content both during and before the current pandemic. For this we used all preprints in de database, and did use a more narrow sampling strategy. Hence, we include all Covid-19 related preprints. In addition, we analysed the number of preprints that also appeared as journal articles, and the average number of days between publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article. The analysis is based on the linkage of preprints and journal articles in the Dimensions Database (https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/index.html). Figure 2 compares the overall duration of journals' publication process prior to and during the present pandemic. It demonstrates that, on average, journals have drastically increased the speed of their processes for Covid-19 publications: average turnaround times in our journal sample has decreased from 117 to 60 days. Comparing the 95% confidence intervals of both statistics, shows the decrease to be highly substantial and significant. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the average duration of the publication process for Covid-19 related articles in journals in our sample. It distinguishes between the periods before and during the pandemic and it splits the entire publication process in the Review stage (between submission and acceptance) and Editorial stage (between acceptance and submission). Figure 3 presents a graphical overview of the average decrease in turnaround time in the period during the crisis compared to the period prior to the pandemic. It again distinguishes between the Review and Editorial stages of the publication process. Note that negative numbers in this case indicate an increase in turnaround time. The figure indicates the Review stage shortens for ten out of the fourteen journals in our sample, while nine journals managed to shorten their Editorial stage. Average acceleration is around 50% for both stages, but it goes up to nearly 100% in some journals. To check whether the acceleration of publication processes is specific to Covid-19 related papers, we analysed the turnaround times for non-Covid-19 related articles published since the start of the pandemic. For all journals in our sample, we selected the ten most recently published articles (as of April 16 th , 2020) about non-Covid-19 related content. In particular, these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning Covid-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or Cov-19 in their title, keywords and abstract. For these articles we also analysed the turnaround times of their publication process. Results are presented in figure 4 . The figure indicates that for most journals, articles not related to Covid-19 have very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic. Unpacking the publication process in the Review and Editorial stage, we conclude that, again, non-Covid-19 related articles follow a very similar pattern to articles published before the pandemic. \\nSome of the most prominent, high impact medical journals are not part of our sample, because they do not share all relevant data on submission, acceptance and publication dates. Comparing the total number of published articles in high impact journals such as BMJ, The Lancet, JAMA and NEJM does not give a clear indication of faster publication: These four journals published 864, 421, 351, and 307 articles respectively in 2020, according to a Web of Science search. Over the same period in 2019 they published 874, 497, 335, and 334 articles respectively. Hence, most show a small decrease in the total number of published articles. Consequently, if they managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles, this has gone at the expense of other content being published less, or less quickly.\\nNext we turn our analysis towards the publication of preprints. As was shown in figure 1 , the number of preprints on Covid-19 related content has seen a sharp increase since the outbreak of the pandemic. In total 2102 preprints were published on seven preprint servers: SSRN Electronic Journal, bioRxiv, ChemRxiv, JMIR Preprints, Research Square, and medRxiv. We note that even though arXiv publications are included in the Dimensions database, they are not included in the 4 April release of the dataset we used, due to technical issues. Out of the 2102 preprints in our dataset, 129 have currently also appeared as journal article. Due to the small number of preprints appearing as journal articles, no statistically relevant conclusions can be drawn about the uptake of preprints in journals. However, analyse the average duration between the publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article we see a steady increase, ranging from, on average, 137 days in 2017 and just over 200 days in 2020. Currently, we do not see any indication of acceleration of the uptake of preprints in journals since the outbreak of \\nAll but one of these preprint-journal article pairs were published prior to the current pandemic. However, comparing the results in tables 1 and 2, it becomes clear that turnaround times for articles that previously appeared as preprints are much shorter than the average turnaround times in these journals. In fact, for these pre-pandemic articles, turnaround times are even shorter than their postpandemic counterparts.\\nOur analysis indicates that the scholarly publishing enterprise has managed to drastically speed up the dissemination of Covid-19 related research material since the outbreak of the pandemic. In particular, academic journals managed to decrease the duration of their publication process by 49%, or 57 days on average, which is a statistically relevant difference. Some journals even show a decrease in publication time of over 80% compared to the pre-crisis era. This acceleration concerns both the stage of review (between submission and acceptance) and the editing stage (between acceptance and publication). The journals in our sample shortened both stages by 47% (45 days) and 61% (14 days) respectively. Hence the majority of the decrease in total publication time is due to speeding up the review process. We also conclude that the acceleration of the publication process is specific to Covid-19 related articles.\\nArticles not related to Covid-19 published during the pandemic show very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic.\\nIn addition to a fast spread of information through journal articles, the number of papers submitted to preprint servers has drastically increased. However, such preprints do not seem to be taken up as journal publications any quicker than they were before the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, articles first appearing as preprints do seem to go through shorter publication processes than articles not appearing as preprints.\\nTo tackle the current health crisis, many have urged to disseminate relevant academic knowledge as fast as possible. Acknowledging that typical publication delays in medical journals are unacceptable in the current era, journals are expected to decrease the turnaround times of their publication process. The results of our study indicate that journals have indeed managed to do so.\\nOur results on the average turnaround times of journal articles prior to the current pandemic corresponds well with earlier findings of studies on publication delays in medical journals (Björk & Solomon, 2013) . However, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, medical journals have managed to drastically accelerate their publication process to make it nearly twice as fast for Covid-19 related articles. On the contrary, articles not related to Covid-19 that were published since the beginning of the pandemic, do not show any acceleration. Their turnaround times are similar to articles published before the pandemic.\\nWhile it seems reasonable that journals might encounter difficulties to attract reviewers with relevant expertise -since those are probably active scientists working on novel research themselves -the contrary seems to be the case. Concluding from our results, it seems that journals are finding enough reviewers willing to review Covid-19 related papers on a very short notice. However, this conclusion should be treated with caution, as no data is available on who reviewed the papers. Maybe the same few experts reviewed a lot more than usual; maybe 'relevant expertise' was taken as a relative criterion, with journals using reviewers that usually would not have counted as experts. The fact that non-Covid-19 related papers are published at similar speeds during and before the pandemic, seems to indicate that journals are also not facing more issues with attracting reviewers for those papers.\\nAs preprint articles are not being included in medical journals more quickly, it seems that either authors are not submitting preprint articles to journals more quickly, or journals are prioritizing content that has not appeared as preprint. Qualitative follow-up research interviewing authors and editors on their submission and review practices regarding preprint articles could shed further light on this.\\nEven though the acceleration of journals' publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination, it also raises several questions and concerns.\\nFirst, one could wonder whether faster is always better. Even though the two do not necessarily exclude each other, it seems reasonable that there is a balance, or perhaps even a trade-off, between speed and quality in peer review. Especially concerning the stage of review, legitimate concerns can be raised on whether speeding up the review process might harm the process' ability to filter incorrect or invalid findings. Such research slipping through peer review, might require corrections or retractions in the future. Given the potentially rapid uptake of medical knowledge in policy and clinical contexts, such corrections might come in too late as potential harm might have already been done. Commentators have raised this concern regarding the usage of information in preprints, but it similarly applies to journal articles. In fact, false information spreading through journal articles is arguably more damaging, since it has the appearance of being 'peer reviewed' and hence properly verified. Scholars have repeatedly warned that a substantial share of articles (hastily) published during this crisis, will require future corrections (Marcus & Oransky, 2020) . Formal expressions of concern -on papers used to make policy decisions -have already been issued (Voss, 2020) . Future research should therefore analyse whether shorter review processes during the Covid-19 pandemic have led to an increase in corrections or retractions of published articles.\\nWhile drastic acceleration of the review stage might evoke quality issues, this arguably applies less to the editorial stage of the publication process. Journals' achievement of shortening this stage of the publication process for Covid-19 related content is purely laudable. However, this might raise questions about why publication delays in this stage are usually higher and whether journals will aim and be able to maintain such standards in a post-crisis era. One potential explanation for the shortened editorial stage is that publishers or journal editors now prioritize Covid-19 related research articles, at the expense of other articles. However, our data on non-Covid-19 related articles published during the pandemic seems to contradict this. It seems like journals are managing to speed up editorial work for Covid-19 related content, while maintaining standards for other articles.\\nSeveral journals show a substantial lengthening of the editorial stage. This might be caused by an increase in the number of manuscripts submitted to the respective journals. For journals showing an increase in total turnaround time, this seems to be concentrated in the editorial process. Since editors themselves might be practicing scientists, the overload of newly submitted manuscripts might be a cause of this additional delay.\\nThis study potentially suffers from various limitations in its analysis. First, it could only analyse those journal articles that have been published. This particularly implies that it was unable to assess the review process' duration for rejected articles. Neither could it analyse articles that are currently still under review.\\nSecond, the analysis does not include article type as a feature of analysis. Some article types, including letters to the editor, perspectives or commentaries, might undergo a different kind of peer reviewthey might for instance only be reviewed by the editor, rather than by external reviewers. A potential difference in distribution of pre-and post-crisis articles over the various article types might explain some of the variation in the publication process' duration.\\nThird, our analyses focus on journals publishing relatively many Covid-19 related articles. Due to a lack of sufficient articles in other, potentially smaller journals, we were not able to analyse those journals. As larger journals may more easily attract reviewers and have more resources, and hence more capacity to shift resources, to execute the editorial stage of publication, the resulting decrease in publication time might be less strong in smaller journals. At a later stage, when more Covid-19 related papers appear in other journals, future research could verify this potential difference.\\nLast, it should be noted that some of the journal articles assigned to our control group concern papers related to previous health crises or pandemics such as the MESH, EBOLA or ZIKA crises. Despite similar incentives to publish those articles quickly, content related to Covid-19 makes its way through the publication process much quicker. Future research could include a more elaborate comparison not only between pre-and post-Covid-19 eras, but also between publishing in the Covid-19 and other health related crises.\\nIn these times of crisis, the rapid dissemination of relevant academic knowledge is of paramount importance.

To assist policymakers and clinical experts, as well as to counter the spread of such disinformation, researchers and academic journals have a responsibility to share available knowledge quickly. The fact that medical journals have managed to considerably speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related content during the current pandemic is therefore laudable. However, some concerns remain about whether faster dissemination might go at the expense of research quality. Quickly spreading false information might do more harm than slowly spreading reliable knowledge.\\n

       "0  we develop a new way to predict the recovery rate of infections following a pandemic outbreak , using the basic postulates of learning theory . this theory has been previously applied to outcome , accident and event data from multiple socio-technological systems , like transportation , medicine , military , power grids , aviation , mining , and manufacturing . learning theory simply postulates that humans learn from experience in correcting their mistakes and errors ( sometimes even just by trial and error ) , as they gain knowledge on the problem and skill for addressing it . the theory is consistent with the models and data in cognitive psychology of how humans behave and the brain operates ( ohlsson , 1996 ; fiondella and duffey , 2015 ; anderson , 1990 ; duffey , 2017b ) . the importance of this theory stands in that human errors and incorrect decisions are the dominant contributors to accidents , crashes , system failures , errors , and operational incidents . the theory is based on the fact that human learning demonstrably reduces error rates ( ohlsson , 1996 ) : wisdom is gained after an accident . evidence on this relates to even highly hazardous industries like the nuclear one . a good example is that the safe operation of nuclear power plants has been , and continuous to be , improved from lessons learned from nuclear accidents and incidents . these accidents and incidents , in addition to highlighting the role of human errors in their occurrence and progression , have helped identifying various critical technical elements and contributed to the safer operation of nuclear power plants . similarly , the observation is applicable to outbreaks of infectious diseases . improving health systems following epidemic outbreaks and enhancing reliability and safety measures following nuclear power plant accidents have to be handled with objective data and accurate calculations . however , whereas nuclear power plant operation has done this by a world-accepted , high standard of procedures , the `` protection system '' against pandemics is not there yet . the key is how to design , evaluate and implement the procedures , for reaching a high standard . learning theory has been successfully applied to quantify error and learning rates in technical systems , casualties in large land battles , everyday accident and event data , and to human , software and hardware reliability ( duffey and saull , 2008 ; duffey & ha , 2010 ; fiondella & duffey , 2015 ; duffey , 2017a ) . the novel feature is to replace calendar time or test interval , which has always been used before , with a measure for the accumulated experience and/or risk exposure , thus defining rate trends and quantifying effectiveness of responses to errors and accidents , and allowing totally different systems to be directly intercompared . additionally , the trend is governed by two parameters that are physically based : the learning rate constant and the minimum achievable error rate . this is in contrast with statistical analysis , where fitting to learning data is typically done on three empirical parameters ( bush and mosteller , 1955 ) , and with the inverse `` power laws '' extensively fitted in cognitive psychology data ( e.g . anderson , 1990 and the references therein ) . the theory shows the learning hypothesis that humans learn from their mistakes and reduce outcomes in such a way that the rate of decrease of the outcome ( in the present case of interest , the infection rate , r ) with the rate of accumulated experience , ε , ( in the present case the advancement in the knowledge of the virus , the contagion spreading dynamics , the effects of the countermeasures ) is proportional to the rate r itself . thus , very simply , the differential equation that describes the accident and outcome data with learning or forgetting describes the proportionality between the rate of change of the learning rate , r , and the learning rate itself ( duffey and saull , 2008 ; duffey , 2017b ) : where ε is the measure of the risk exposure , learning opportunity or experience/knowledge gained ; k is the learning rate ( positive for a learning/improving situation and negative for no learning/improving , e.g . because of no effectiveness countermeasures ) and rm is the lowest or minimum achievable error rate , which is never zero as the process of error-making and cognitive rule revision always continues . physically , k is related to the non-detection or error rate in unconscious memory scanning for recall and recognition , manifesting itself in the conscious external actions , decisions and judgments . the error rate solution obtained from integration of this minimum error rate equation ( mere ) is : where , 0 is the initial rate at the beginning or start of the problem when the level of experience/knowledge on it is ε= ε0 . different data sets are characterized by different values of the learning constant . it is clear in equation ( 2 ) that for practical applications a suitable measure of the experience/knowledge or risk exposure accumulated with respect to the initial one , ( ε-ε0 ) , is needed and that the original or starting one , ε0 , is a suitable arbitrary or convenient reference dependent on the problem at hand . in other words , the measure for the accumulated experience/knowledge or risk exposure is technology/system specific . then , for data inter-comparisons , it is useful to render non-dimensional the quantities of interest , which results in the universal learning curve ( ulc ) for the non-dimensional error rate e*= ( r ( ε ) -rm ) / ( r0-rm ) as a function of the non-dimensional experience/knowledge or risk exposure ε* = ε/ εt , where εt is the maximum accumulated experience or risk exposure thanks to which the error is recovered ( the problem is considered under control ) , its rate having reached the lowest or minimum achievable value rm . from ( 2 ) , * = with k~ 3 is the fitted learning rate `` universal constant '' . this expression has already been shown to represent the learning trends for outcome rate data from industrial , surgical , transportation , mining , manufacturing , chemical , maintenance , software and a multitude of other systems ( duffey and saull , 2008 ; ha , 2013 : fiondella and duffey , 2015 ) . for skill acquisition tasks in cognitive psychological testing , this same trend exists and is called the universal law of practice ( ulp ) . illnesses are still around in the world , many of them deadly . in the past , there have been pandemics1 killing many millions of people , like the `` black death '' or bubonic plague disease of the middle ages , and the influenza epidemic in 1918. in addition to these sudden attacks , other equally deadly pestilences have been and are still around for centuriesyellow fever , cholera , small pox , typhus , measles , malaria ... . as modern medical practice eliminated or reduced these hazards using better procedures and new vaccines , other exotic variants and viruses have recently emerged , like sars , hiv , ebola and covid19 , infecting and endangering the ever-increasing and interconnected world population . as we evolve and learn , so do the things that like to kill us , but they usually kill relatively few people compared to , say , automobile accidents or the yearly seasonal influenza . to determine risk from these instances , we can and must turn to data . as a fine example , we have the official data from the world health organization . the who gave the death rates for `` all causes '' and for infectious ( like cholera ) and parasitic ( like malaria ) diseases for some 194 countries in the mid 1990s . the data cover the full global spectrum , from developed to developing nations , from vast urban conglomerates with very crowded living conditions to scattered rural communities , from jungles to deserts , and all continents . the data cover and include the effects of modern epidemics , and of course local wars and regional conflicts . in figure 1 , the data are plotted not against the usual arbitrary calendar year but-as we now know we should -against the risk exposure measure , in this case the population size . this number is the direct indicator of how many people are at risk , and the country-bycountry populations come from the world bank indicators . the data are plotted in the figure with the lozenges being the overall death rate data and the squares representing the death rate data due to infections . from these data , we can know the risk of death from any health cause : it is about 1000 deaths for every 100,000 people , or one in a hundred , and does not depend much on where you live . to verify this overall number `` locally '' , we can analyze the data for new york , as given in the graph `` the conquest of pestilence in new york city '' from 1800 onwards , published by the board of health and the health department . this is a typical modern city that had grown in population from 120,000 to about 8 million people , and includes characteristics of immigration , high-density living , mass transportation , high-rise apartments , modern health care , national and international trade , and a large flow of inbound-outbound travel , in other words , globalization . the biggest improvement in health has come from introducing effective hygiene and anti-infection measures , and from improved health prevention and treatment ( not from wonder drugs ) : we have learned how to treat sick people , cure problems and reduce the spread of bad diseases . it is an expensive investment and it is hard work that requires devoted and trained professionals . as a result , after curing and containing many pestilences during the 19th century , the average death rate in new york over the last hundred years has fallen to 10 to 11 per 1000 people , or almost exactly the same one-in-a-hundred rate as the world rate . so modern cities behave pretty much like whole countries , as far as average or overall death rates are concerned . infectious and parasitic diseases are responsible for 5 to 15 deaths in 100,000 people , so average about one in ten thousand or 1 to 5 % of all deaths worldwide , the other 95 to 99 % or so being deaths from `` normal '' causes . so the `` normal '' death risk is still about twenty to a hundred times of what it might be if a new pestilence emerges , spreads and takes hold without effective countermeasures . another way to view this risk contribution is to say that the chance of death might be increased by a maximum of about 5 % if a new global pandemic infection occurs where it has not been prevalent before . this is always the fear , that in today 's highly interconnected , high-speed , global world a possible rapid spread of new or variant diseases can occur . all rights reserved . no reuse allowed without permission .

recently happened , as the 2019-2020 coronavirus ( labeled covid-19 or sars-cov2 ) rapidly spread across the four corners of the globe . there was extensive reporting of nearly every new case occurring and great worldwide information available ( e.g . at johns hopkins university website coronavirus.jhu.edu/map ) . by late march 2020 , the world had over 1,000,000 cases ( and still growing at the time of writing ) and many thousands of deaths , with the infection having spread quickly across borders , imported from nation-to-nation mainly via travellers , visitors and tourists , and spread internally from just social and day-to-day human contact . looking at the available numbers , the individual infection risk today is comparatively negligible , with a few hundred thousand cases in a world population of several billion . it is an individual random infection probability , p ( i ) , of about one in twenty thousand . this risk is many times less than the chance of being hospitalized with influenza , let alone catching it , reflecting the existing fraction of world deaths due to infections . but the high speed at which this virus has spread makes it legitimate to feel worried and unease , and correspondingly , legitimate questions arise : how does this novel pandemic compare to the `` normal '' or accepted risk of infectious death ? what is the `` worst case '' scenario ? should we panic and shun other people who may be carrying what might kill us ? how long will it take to recover ? this calls for the need to try to objectively evaluate the risk , based on the current experience knowledge . we normally can treat the spread of disease as a `` diffusion '' or `` multiple contact '' process , where it steadily expands outward from some central source or origin ; or as a highly mobile source that is potentially spread everywhere due to rapid multiple global personal and social interactions . the excellent us centers for disease control simply states the obvious : '' risk depends on characteristics of the virus , including how well it spreads between people '' ( source : www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary ) the data from china on covid-19 infections suggest that there is , or was , a 50 % -90 % chance of the initial infections spreading between cities , depending on location and size ( du et al , 2020 ) . using simple doubling rates , the news media carried projections that a `` worst case '' in the usa could infect over 200 million ( i.e . most people in the usa ) and cause nearly 2 million or so deaths , and experts were hard at work estimating global , country and age-dependent risks , including of death . we certainly need to estimate or know the risk of infection . as a simple guess and knowing nothing else , let us assume infections are randomly transmitted anywhere and everywhere from person to person , the spread is instantaneous and guaranteed if a source exists and the probability of being ( successfully ! ) infected is also random and equally possible . this is really a `` worst case '' scenario or `` model '' , as obviously not everyone is exposed to everyone and not everyone is equally vulnerable . the worst case scenario is , then , that there is no preventative measures , no immunity and no vaccine , and for whatever reason , the source is not quarantined or isolated , and any such infected person or mobile source can and does transmit the virus ( or disease ) randomly to others somewhere in the world . independent of the transmission mechanism , given contact , the probability of crossinfection , then , depends solely on the total numbers of the possibly equally risk-or infection-exposed recipient population , and the probability of infection is also random . in this model , anyone can get it by interacting with someone that has it2 . to help see this more clearly , the black balls ( the `` unknowns '' ) emerging from the jar of life is one way to view what might happen based on what we have already seen or been exposed to . here the one black ball ( n=1 ) is an `` known unknown '' infected person or infection opportunity among those ten ( m=10 ) non-infected ( `` known knowns '' ) white balls ( m=10 ) , so a chance of 10 % or one over ten . the probability of interest is , then , of infection for more people exposed and infected , or n `` unknown unknowns '' , and some not exposed or not successfully infected , m `` unknown knowns '' ) , out of a total of all exposed people , n+m . these numbers , n and m , vary by city , country , cruise ship passengers , soccer matches or rock concert arena , and can systematically vary up to the total of about six billions or so in the global world . we can also think of it as our possible exposure experience . the formula for the probability p of the event of an individual i becoming infected takes the form , p ( i ) = number infected ( n ) / total number exposed ( n+m ) . if there is a gathering limit of ten or so people , as in the case of the white and black balls of the jar of life shown in the picture , the observed chance of being infected , p ( i ) , is assumed to be about one infection ( black ball ) in some ten non-infections ( white balls ) , or 10 % . this we know . but the sample is limited to 10 and , so , we could also be exposed to one in a hundred , or one in a thousand , or more : how many more infection cases would we , then , expect out there hidden in the jar ? the method used to estimate this probability is random sampling based on the so-called hypergeometric formula3 . for possible gathering numbers of 10,100 , 300 and 1000 with one infection source known or observed , the chance of observing or finding , say , 100,000 new cases of infection , p ( i ) in a bigger group rises to a maximum or peak of about 37 % ( about one in three ) 4. the estimate that comes out in this `` worst case scenario '' seemingly agrees with the estimates publicly available on the internet and social media of the awful possibility ( risk ) of perhaps even a 40-70 % chance of being at risk of infection , if nothing is done to prevent it or reduce it5 . that is a significant and very high risk of infection , and has been used to justify quarantining , limiting social gatherings and extensive travel restrictions . this inevitably brings fear to the individuals of the global population and the only way to address fear is by using scientific knowledge and data to inform any theory behind estimates and predictions . during the early onset of the covid-19 pandemic , many gloomy scenarios were made and analyzed but they generally assumed no effective countermeasures to the spread of infections . the infection numbers grew quickly at first , before countermeasures such as isolation , distancing , restrictions and curfews were implemented to reduce infection rates and `` flatten the curve '' of numbers versus time . sad to say , deaths ( distressing as they are ) are also not the right measure-infections are the measure for the spread and control of infectious diseases . a logical question is whether the infection or death data show any signs that we are learning how to reduce risk ? just like for any accident-the number killed or dying is highly variable depending on who and how many risk-exposed happens to be there , so it is random . in this viral case , the number of deaths also just depends on too many uncontrolled variables and factors ( age , pre-existing health conditions , health care system , propensity etc . … ) so the average death percentage per infection also varies in magnitude , location and time ( as the data clearly show ) . the correct measure is infection numbers and rates ( not the number of deaths ) , say the number per day . the infections numbers also depend on which country/region they refer to and at what infectious stage ( early onset , spread extent , countermeasures employed ... etc. ) . we already know that if uncontrolled , the increase in infections will rise exponentially , as the rate of infections is proportional to the number infected . as usual , the most representative case can be based on actual infection data from where containment of contagion has already been successfully applied , namely in china where it originated . using data reported by the john hopkins center for system science and engineering , by march , 2020 , there were , n= 81,000 infections and some 3200 deaths in china with a falling to near-zero rate . so with a national population of n+m =1,400,000,000 , the overall probable risk of infection is about 0.00006 , or one in 17,000 , ( or about six in 100,000 ) 6. locally , in some cities/regions it is ten times higher , but although comparable to infectious death rates , the overall covid-19 death rate in china was on average one in nearly half a million people , much lower than deaths from other infectious diseases . that is a significant reduction in the risk of infection : countermeasures have worked . so far , we have these scenarios : the scary or `` worst '' with no measures : at least one in three people infected . the real or `` best '' control and mitigation : only one in 17000 people infected . the probable future is the past modified by the likelihood . so the possible probability reduction , or likelihood , must be considered in a future estimate based on projections using past data . this simple-minded upper and lower limit comparison suggests the individual likelihood is about 0.0002 , or very low . societal countermeasures reduced the risk by a factor of 500 to 5000 over the inevitable `` worst case '' random spread of infection or survival-of-only-the-fittest scenarios . the approach based on learning theory illustrated in this section uses the fact that humans learn how to control the covid-19 outbreak spread and reduce infection rates using countermeasures ( treatments , isolation , `` social distancing '' etc ) . if these are effective the rate , therefore , must reach a peak and , then , decline . to look at pandemic recovery , we really need to look at the rate of infections , not just deaths since these depend on too many social and personal health factors as already stated . these include propensity , age profile , medical system effectiveness , treatment options early detection , etc . the risk of an infectious disease is not controlled unless the infection rate slows down , so-called 'flattening the curve '' . once the rate peaks the rate , then , should decrease due to successful countermeasures ( whatever they are ) . so , the next question is : what happens next and how do we know how effective the control measures are , and how long before they can be relaxed or maintained ? in china , the actual infection rates ( increase per day ) rose to a peak of nearly 4000 a day in about 17 to 20 days , and , then , fell away steadily to about 50 or so a day by another 30 days . as a further consideration for a different country , s korea had a different peak rate of about 1000 per day in ten days , falling to a low rate in another 10 or so days . in italy , after some delay in implementing countermeasures , the infection rate seemingly peaked at about 6000 per day in about 30 or so days , as can be seen in the graph of figure 3 . as of writing , ( early april ) this rate has decreased to nearly 4000 per day ( see graph in the figure ) . the results for all countries that show some form of recovery are reported in the figure 4 graph , which plots as , e* , the non-dimensional infection rate normalized to the initial peak value , versus n* = ε/ εt , the non-dimensional elapsed time of experience/knowledge or risk italy data all rights reserved . no reuse

https : //doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060319 doi : medrxiv preprint exposure after the rate has peaked ( number of days after peak/day of peak ) . in relation to the equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of learning theory above , the infection rate takes the role of the error rate r , the risk exposure time , ε , corresponds to the accumulated experience/knowledge from which we learn and is measured in days , the time of peak εt , is the time for the rate to approach its achievable minimum value , rm ( the lowest or minimum achievable error rate , in equation ( 2 ) . based on the available data for china and s korea , using countermeasures , the overall recovery timescale is about 20-30 days to attain the minimum infection rate of about 50 per day . for further direct comparison , we plot also the reduction curve of the world pulmonary disease death rate per day for 1870 -1970 ( source : human nature , t.mckeown , april , 1978 as given in horwitz and ferleger `` statistics for social change '' ) . we can simply think of this overall world data over the years , and its reduction trend , as resulting from many pandemics and multiple outbreaks of influenzas and differing virus strains , that have been more and more successfully treated as we have learned to better control/reduce infections and improved effect recovery , thus steadily reducing the rate . despite the huge differences in timescales , the `` recovery rate curve '' is simply the exponential universal learning curve of equation ( 3 ) the covid -19 pandemic and pulmonary disease recovery rate data all fit with the universal learning curve trend ( which is known to fit millions of events with learning ) . the infection rate , e* , normalized to the initial peak value , as a function of the time elapsed the key point is that all the data follow almost exactly the same decreasing trajectory and , furthermore , the learning curve is nearly the same ( k~3 ) , as previously found for any learning experience on outcomes , accidents , events of any other modern technological system operated by humans . indeed , the results surprisingly follow the curve developed some ten years after it was first discovered , while working on completely different data . we can claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction also in this case of the pandemic , and call it the universal recovery curve . to further confirm the urc general theoretical correlation , we next compare to the latest projections for medical resource loads made by complex computer modeling of infections and deaths in the usa ( ihme , 2020 ) . as a reasonable surrogate measure , the number of required hospital beds was assumed to be proportional to the number of infections , which daily values were directly transcribed from the website graph ( available at covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america ) . the interval available is a projection from a peak resource use on april 15th out to july 1st , 2020 , so to be consistent with the actual available country data . the infection rate per day , r , was calculated until attaining an assumed but realistic minimum rate , rm , of 50 per day on 10th june ( 55 days later ) . all rights reserved . no reuse allowed without permission . author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . the

china data circles , s. korea open triangles ) and the widely used ihme model projections with the universal learning curve shown in the figures 4 and 5 are compelling . the data fits with learning curve theory , which we know already incidentally fits millions of events , accidents and trends . china , italy and s. korea have indeed learned how to control the spread of a viral pandemic . all other countries/systems/people have to do to predict the infection rate evolution is to follow the same trend after first reaching their rate peak . this type of analysis allows countries and systems to compare the effectiveness of their countermeasures implemented to control the pandemics and the related timescales . a word of caution is necessary , however , these numbers can not be exact and are not meant to be exact . these are just calculated risk estimates , which are subject to uncertainty related to all the many endogenous factors related to the virus spreading , and the actuation and respect of the measures implemented . the numbers provide guidance to thinking about the absolute risk and the best approach to take given the risk is constant unless we do nothing to reduce it ! the strong message here is that the rational and logical approach to dealing with the risk of the occurring pandemic ( as with any other risk , for that matter ) is to limit own personal and potential exposure , and to minimize both the size and scale of the potentially exposed population . this is precisely what governments and contagious disease experts have been saying all along-but is also what any individual should be doing anyway while exposed to the risks of `` normal '' life . a sort of ethics of resilience ( b. rajaonah and e. zio , 2020 ) . in the above graph of figure 4 , the infection reduction/recovery rate for italy was estimated to occur in about 30 days , by assuming it was a timeframe similar to that of china . the present prediction is , then , that there is at least a 30-day recovery timeframe as the horizon for the infection rate to get down to a minimum achievable level of say 50 per day ( as for china ) ; infection rates should be below 10 % of the peak ( i.e . about 600 per day ) in about 3 weeks from the peak . but this prediction can be effectively monitored and should be updated as more data arises . in fact , at present , only very few days have elapsed since the seemingly reached peak rate , so it is useful to look at a future trajectory . this can be done as in figure 6 , by plotting the data simply changing the denominator of the non-dimensional elapsed time after the peak rate n* from the 30 days ( 27 march to 27 april ) assumed in analogy to china , to say 20 days ( 27 march to 6 april ) or 40 days ( 27 march to 6 may ) for estimated reduction to the ( non-zero ) minimum ( i.e . 50-100 per day ) . this sensitivity analysis allows to verify , based on objective data , whether or not any change or improvement in countermeasures is warranted , and by how much . the calculations can assume the infection rate peaked either on about 24 march or march 29 , the latter being shown as giving the fewest data points ( see figure 6 above ) in this paper , we have originally proposed to adapt learning theory for describing the reduction of pandemic infections like that of covid-19 . a key point is to look at infection rate , as a measure of error outcome , and time , as a measure of experience/knowledge or risk exposure which allows learning . the analyses of the currently available data show that the covid-19 infection rate data follow , after peaking , almost exactly the universal learning curve describing the decreasing trajectory of many other instances where humans learn to apply effective countermeasures . more specifically , the learning curve is nearly the same ( with universal constant k~3 ) as for any learning experience reducing outcomes , accidents and events for other modern technological system operated by humans . we claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction , also in this case of the pandemic , and call it the universal recovery curve . it can be used to predict the expected time at which the pandemic will be under control , in terms of minimum achievable infection rate , and to test and demonstrate the

       "1  the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease , covid-19 , originated in wuhan , a city located in central china , in early december , is fast spreading to more than 30 countries ( benvenuto et al. , 2020 ; she et al. , 2020 ) . in less than 3 months , the disease has infected more than 70,000 people globally , and has caused more than 2,000 deaths . on january 30 th , 2020 , the world health organization declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern . upon composing this manuscript , the coronavirus is concurrently spreading and claiming more than 100 lives per day . this outbreak induces an urgency to determine the characteristics of covid-19 transmission and implement optimal strategies to control the epidemic . coronavirus is an enveloped , positive-sense , single stranded rna virus found in a variety of mammals , including bats , civets , camel , and pangolins ( ge et al. , 2013 ; kandeil et al. , 2019 ; liu et al. , 2007 ; rockx et al. , 2011 ) . two strains of coronaviruses , sars-cov-1 and mers-cov , have been reported to cause severe respiratory syndromes , resulting in deadly epidemics in 2002 and 2012 , respectively ( fung and liu , 2019 ; luk et al. , 2019 ) . this current coronavirus , denoted as sars-cov-2 , is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans . ( benvenuto et al. , 2020 ) . to effectively fight and end the covid-19 epidemic , the transmission of the disease and zoonotic source of origin must be accurately identified , leading to the discovery of an optimal strategy to control this outbreak . by studying the cases and clinical features from early reports , this paper illustrates rigorous epidemiological models and the associated statistical methods to estimate the transmission rates in different stages and scenarios and predict the outcomes for different control strategies . the numbers of cases from january 21 st to february 20 th , 2020 were obtained from the daily reports by national health commission ( nhc ) of china . as nhc did not release case reports until january 21 st , the case numbers prior to january 21 st were obtained from two recent clinical reports ( huang et al. , 2020 ; li et al. , 2020 ) . the number of patients diagnosed out of wuhan was obtained from the report by which summarized 1,099 cases confirmed by january 29 th , 2020. the case numbers for the diamond princess cruise were obtained from the daily reports by yokohama port quarantine center . a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine model was used for transmission analysis and prediction of epidemiological spread , cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a

//doi.org/10 . /2020 where s , e , i , q and n were the number of susceptible ( s ) , exposed ( e ) , infectious ( i ) , quarantined ( q ) and total population . the population in wuhan ( n ) is 11,081,000. assuming that a patient was quarantined immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed , q was equal to the confirmed number of cases . β is the daily transmission rate , defined as the expected number of infections caused by one infectious person per day . once a susceptible ( s ) person becomes infected , the status is changed to exposed for an incubation period , 1/α . theoretically , the patient is not infectious during the incubation period . after incubation , the patient experiences disease onset and becomes infectious ( i ) . the time interval between disease onset to quarantine ( q ) is the infectious time , 1/γ . because the seiq model can not be solved explicitly , β was estimated using the monte carlo method , which simulated the two independent poisson processes : daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time . to estimate β , there are two scenarios to consider . firstly , the number of cases may only be available at the beginning and end of the study period . the examples used were the diamond princess cruise and wuhan prior to january 20 th when the diagnosis kit was not sufficiently available . in this scenario , β was estimated by monte carlo approximation of the number of cases at the end of the targeted time period . secondly , the number of q is made available each day for the examples and the number of confirmed cases in china after january 20 th . in this scenario , γ was first determined from clinical reports for the targeted time period , and then β was estimated by minimizing the mean squared errors from 1,000 monte carlo samples that approximated the q curve . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display

were generated given β , γ , initial e , and initial i. the simulation was based on two independent poisson processes : daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time . the daily means and 95 % confidence intervals for q were obtained over 1,000 monte carlo runs . epidemiological analysis was performed on data collected from the mainland of china between january 1 st and january 20 th , 2020. during this period , the suspected zoonotic source , the huanan seafood market , was closed and travel restrictions were not yet enforced by the government . based on the reported clinical analysis for the 425 cases prior to january 23 rd , the average inoculation time interval was found to be 5.2 days and the average time interval from disease onset to a clinical visit was 5.8 days . in this study , the total number of cases , 8247 , including both confirmed and suspected patients , on january 26 , 2020 were used as the number of onsets ( i+e ) for january 20 th , 2020. in the same way , the total number of cases reported between january 1 st and january 7 th , which totaled 136 , was used as i0 in the seiq model . because the seiq model can not be solved explicitly , monte carlo simulation was exploited to determine the daily transmission rate β0=0.44 with 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 0.43 to 0.47 ( figure 1a ) . given the mean time interval between onset and hospital quarantine of 12.5 days , the basic reproductive number , r0 , was estimated to be 5.5 ( 95 % ci 5.3 to 5.8 ) . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a

//doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026773 doi : medrxiv preprint most of infected cases in december 2019 were linked to the huanan seafood market , which retails seafood and wild animals . it is believed that an enclosed and crowded environment is favorable for coronavirus transmission , however the epidemiological data is lacking . to test the hypothesis , the recent diamond princess cruise epidemic was used as a comparable case study . a clear disease outbreak was reported on this cruise . a passenger , who visited china on january 10 th , was on board from january 20 th and january 25 th before being confirmed with a sars-cov-2 infection . all people on board have been quarantined at sea since february 5 th and 621 out of 3711 people were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 . as some of the patients were known to be infected after the quarantine , possibly due to central air conditioning and family infection , only the confirmed cases ( n=135 ) by february 10 th ( five days incubation plus one day diagnosis ) were used for a conservative estimation of transmission . using a seiq model while q=0 , the daily transmission rate , β , was found to be 1.04 ( 95 % ci 0.69-1.87 ) ( figure 1b ) , which is twice as much as the transmission rate in open cities . using the infection period of 12.5 days , the effective reproductive number on the cruise , rc , was 13.0 ( 95 % ci 8.63-23.375 ) . the link between many of the december cases and the huanan seafood market indicates that the huanan seafood market is one of the zoonotic origins of sars-cov-2 , if not only . after the forced shutdown of the huanan seafood market on january 1 st , the effectiveness of the zoonotic infection and a potential secondary source of sars-cov-2 that continued to infect the wuhan people remained in question . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . is the ( which was not

the hunan seafood market in december 2019. the first sars-cov-2 onset was found on december 1 st 2019 ( huang et al. , 2020 ) , and by the 1 st of january , 41 patients were confirmed and quarantined . using the 5.8-day interval between disease onset and clinical visit , 136 cases diagnosed in the first 6 days of january were included , bringing the total number of infections to 177. given β0=0.44 , the development of the epidemic was simulated by initializing with a range of numbers ( from 1 to 5 ) of infections on december 1 st using the seiq model . it showed that at most one infected patient can be allowed in the model , which induced a mean of 174 infections ( 95 % ci 161-187 ) by january 1 st . instead of one , if two unrelated people were infected by december 1 st , the 95 % ci would be ( 291 , 318 ) on january 1 st , significantly larger than the expected 177 cases . thus , the transmission would be so minimal that it would not substantially contribute to the final number of infections , even if there existed a second zoonotic source . in the same sense , the results did not support a continuous zoonotic source within the huanan seafood market , which would have resulted in a higher overall number of infections in the later trajectory . as an rna virus , coronavirus conveys a high mutation rate ( benvenuto et al. , 2020 ) , raising concerns whether the transmission would change between generations . the significantly higher mortality rate observed in wuhan suggested that the transmission may attenuate over generations . to test this hypothesis , the patients infected in december 2019 were considered as the first generation because most of the cases had links to the huanan market , while the patients infected in january 2020 were considered the second-or-later generation . given the data from december ( assuming there is only one case at the beginning of december ) , β was estimated to be . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made

//doi.org/10 . 1101 0.41 ( 95 % ci 0.31-0.56 ) ( figure 1c ) , which was not significantly different from the transmission rate β0=0.45 , obtained between january 1 st and 20 th . furthermore , the transmission rates between wuhan and other cities were also compared . based on guan et al 's analysis of 1,099 patients confirmed by january 29 th , 616 were identified outside of wuhan . out of the 616 patients193 had recently visited wuhan . using a mean infectious period of 5 days , β was calculated to 0.438 ( β= ( 616-193 ) /193/5=0.438 ) , which was within the 95 % confidence interval of the previous estimation of β0 in wuhan , 0.44 ( 95 % ci 0.43-0.47 ) . therefore , no evidence of attenuation of transmission was found . unprecedented measures were taken in wuhan to stop the spread of covid-19 . immediately after the official announcement of the novel coronavirus , home isolations and personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves were enforced . public transportation was limited and , eventually , all canceled . on january 23 rd , the government suspended all plane , train and bus travel in and out of wuhan . on february 2 nd , a comprehensive quarantine strategy was taken by the chinese government . all home-isolated patients were mandated to be hospitalized in the newly built square cabin hospitals , and all people who had suspected symptoms or had close contacts were demanded for mandatory isolation in the quarantine stations . the effects of these steps may not be clear until the end of the epidemic . nevertheless , an intermediate analysis is needed for evaluating various control strategies . considering the one-day delay in the quarantine of the patients in the square cabin hospitals , the seiq model was used to fit the data into two phases , from january 23 rd to february 2 nd , and from february 3 rd to february 20 th . in the first phase , γ was chosen to be 1/6 based on the analysis by . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license

https : //doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026773 doi : medrxiv preprint ( yang et al. , 2020 ) . using least squared errors for an exhaustive search of β , the optimal transmission rate became 0.54 , which was greater than the basic transmission rate β0=0.44 ( figure 2a ) . in the second phase , the time interval from disease onset to quarantine was assumed to drop by another 50 % due to the implication of the square cabin hospitals . thus , γ=1/6 , the transmission rate β decreased to 0.10 , which was an 81.5 % reduction from the first phase and a 77.3 % reduction from the basic transmission rate . in conclusion , the aggressive quarantine strategy of building square cabin hospitals has effectively decreased the transmission , whereas the usefulness of the travel ban , home isolation , and personal protection is still unclear . to further investigate the timing of the comprehensive quarantine , given β=0.10 and γ=1/6 , simulated isolations were employed to track the numbers of confirmed cases ( q ) at various starting dates , january 1 st , 10 th , 20 th , and 30 th . the initial number of cases was estimated by the seiq model . the predicted q value was plotted on a logarithm scale up to february 29 th ( figure 2b ) . it was noted that all curves tended to stabilize after the quarantine measures , and the time interval to stabilization increased as the number of initial cases increased . beginning the quarantine on january 1 st , 136 initial cases were reported . curve stabilization was achieved after about 10 days , with 235 cases reported at the end of this period . january 10 th started with approximately 1,250 cases and ended with 1,834 cases and january 20 th started with about 8,250 and ended with about 12,000. the january 30 th quarantine took almost 20 days to reach stabilization , and the final number of cases , 62,635 , was nearly double the initial number of cases , 38,397. it was noted that the prediction was rather accurate as illustrated by the small 95 % ci ( gray area ) , and the ci decreased to negligible as the initial number of cases increased . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available

determined to be 3 with 95 % ci being 2 to 4 ( dye and gay , 2003 ) . however , contrary to public knowledge , the earlier reports from the covid-19 outbreak provided a r0 number less than or equal to that for sars wu et al. , 2020 ; zhou et al. , 2020 ) . this may have resulted from an inaccurate number of clinical cases due to delayed clinical visits , overloading of clinical resources , and a low sensitivity of the covid-19 diagnosis kit . with more clinical reports published , the case numbers were adjusted based on the information presented , which gave a more accurate transmission estimation . the basic reproductive number for covid-19 was then found to be 5.6 , which is substantially higher than that for sars . in an enclosed and crowded environment , the transmission of sars-cov-2 was thought to significantly increase . the diamond princess cruise provided an excellent case study as the development of covid-19 on the cruise line has a clear infectious source , exposure time , quarantine time , and total number of infections . the transport of the virus through the central air conditioning system and the ineffective quarantine of the ship 's crew , however , raised some concerns . nevertheless , a conservative estimation of transmission using only 50 % of the confirmed cases has proven the high transmission rate in an enclosed crowded ship . this suggested that the initial offense within the huanan seafood market could be at a high level . the likely zoonotic origin also raised questions about additional sources other than the huanan seafood market . this argument was partially supported by several early cases with no . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to

test the hypothesis of a second zoonotic source , and the development of case numbers did not support this hypothesis . though our model can not completely exclude the possibility of additional zoonotic sources , it suggested a minimal effect by such sources . furthermore , the model did not support the constant zoonotic infection within huanan seafood market throughout december . if the zoonotic transgression was sustained , a larger number of infected cases would have been observed . based on the data from the diamond process cruise , the transmission rate was higher in an enclosed and crowded place , like the huanan seafood market . however , similar transmission rate was observed in december as in january . this is likely due to the market 's daytime only operating hours , reducing the contact time . this result further suggested similar transmission rate between generations , which was confirmed by comparing the transmission in wuhan and other cities . high mutation rates have been observed in the genome sequences collected from more than 100 human specimens . however , the effect that these mutations have on transmission may not be observed in such a short time period . the chinese government took unprecedented measures to fight the new epidemic and those measures raised global controversy for their necessity and effectiveness . the restrictive travel ban and home isolation enforced in wuhan was expected to largely decrease the transmission and prevent further spread of the disease within weeks . nevertheless , the coronavirus infection was continuously increasing exponentially in late january and early february in wuhan . in this model , an increase in the transmission rate ( from 0.44 to 0.54 ) was observed during this time period . it suggested that the travel ban and home isolation can not effectively prevent the disease spread . this was likely due to the probable cross-contamination in the long waiting lines at the . cc-by-nc-nd

be hospitalized . a low sensitivity of diagnosis further increased the waiting time for a confirmed case . insufficient hospital beds resulted in a large number of home isolated patients , often leading to family infection . observing the tremendous epidemic , the chinese government built square cabin hospitals with more than twenty thousand beds and quickly moved all patients into these hospitals . all people with suspected symptoms or with close patient contacts were isolated in the government-managed quarantine stations . this comprehensive quarantine method has successfully reduced the transmission rate by 81.5 % , and also greatly shortened the infectious time interval . the analysis in this study showed that the epidemic can be controlled within a few weeks if the comprehensive quarantine was conducted on january 20 th or earlier . concurrently with the development of this manuscript , it was reported that south korea had more than 1,000 home isolations in the city of daegu for a suspected sars-cov-2 infection . it is highly recommended that other countries immediately quarantine all suspected patients . this model was developed using the cases up to february 20 th . as the case numbers increase , the transmission features may change and some of the assumptions , such as the infectious period , may vary . the cases reported in wuhan were known to be less than the actual number in january due to overloading of clinical resources and the low sensitivity of diagnosis . this study attempted to overcome these limitations by using the clinical information verified by several reports and relying only on the beginning and ending cases . therefore , this model tended to reflect the real trend of this critical epidemic and it provides more convincing evidence to guide the control of this disease by the government . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to

       "2  early april by the end of may ( 70 days ) . in the scenario , that no further actions are implemented , the spread of covid-19 is expected to continue slowly , reaching 21,000 by mid-june . the same process has been applied to review the confirmed cases , deaths and recovered dataset . the forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days ; a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the iranian new year 's celebration , farvardin , first month of spring ( 30 th march in western calendar ) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event . the best predictive model predicts the number of reported deaths of covdi-19 to be between 3,000-5,000 and the number of recovered cases between 5,000 -30,000 from the total confirmed cases in the range of 35,000-70,000 infected cases . conclusions : the modeling of covid-19 outbreak shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing . contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be haves this one . this is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person . disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing . in addition , many factors are effective in stopping the disease . these include citizens ' participation in the prevention process , health education , the effectiveness of instructive traditions , environmental conditions , and so on . . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . is the ( which was not peer-reviewed ) the copyright holder for this preprint . https : //doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20041095 doi : medrxiv preprint introduction : on 31 december 2019 , the world health organization ( who ) office located in china was informed of pneumonia of unknown etiology cases ( unknown cause ) detected in wuhan city , hubei province of china . who reported that a novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) , named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) and chosen by international committee on taxonomy of viruses on 11 february 2020 , was identified as the causative virus by chinese authorities on 7 january . ( 1 ) during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic , iran reported its first confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 infections on 19 february 2020 in qom ( 2 ) . as of 17 march 2020 , according to iranian health authorities , there had been 988 covid-19 deaths in iran with more than 16,000 confirmed infections ( 3,4,5 ) this respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus is one of the leading causes for serious illnesses in people all over the world . according to the global statistics of fatalities caused by coronavirus , and its spread in iran , it is vital and essential to forecast its outbreak by a model . as the outbreak of coronavirus disease , 2019 ( covid-19 ) , is a worldwide pandemic , it is rapidly expanding in iran , real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions . previously , real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility , severity , and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak , such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , the 2009 influenza pandemic , and ebola . analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters , such as the incubation and infectious periods , and delays between infection and detection , isolation , and reporting of cases . however , official individual patient data rarely become publicly available , when the information is most needed . this is an analysis of the covid-19 out-break in iran . in this population-level observational study , i used the iranian ministry of health reports downloaded from github , an online data-sharing platform . this dataset is updated on a daily basis with a 24 hour delay . the dataset includes time-stamped counts of the daily cases and deaths within each province in iran . in this study , we will build a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces . i will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases , deaths and recovered for the whole country . . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv

in this study , i have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series . this method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree -more recent values are given a greater weight . due to the lack of historical data , seasonality analysis has been removed from the modeling and the trends are analyzed based on the daily timeframe . the available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value , such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season . the trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time . the predictive model will be tested against four regression model evaluations for robustness . they are as follow : • mae -mean absolute error , this gives less weight to the outliers • mape -similar to mse , but normalized by true observation . the downside is when the true observation is zero , this metric could be problematic . • mse -mean squared error , it is like a combination measurement of bias ad variance of the prediction . for example , bias squared add variance . . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to

. the purpose of this test is to see how well the model fits the dataset without over-fitting it . the aic score rewards models that achieve a high goodness-of-fit score ad penalizes them if they become over complex . a low aic score indicates a better fit . since the outbreak has begun in early february 2020 , the rate of infection and number of deaths has been increased significantly as seen in the illustration below . on the 19 th february , the first 2 deaths were reported , on the 23 rd february , 4 other provinces reported covid-19 deaths , and within the space 28 days the virus has spreaded across the whole country ( see illustration 2 ) , by 20 th march 2020 , tehran , the capital city of iran reported approximately to 4000 confirmed cases of covid-19 . . cc-by-nd 4.0

based on the exponential smoothing model , the projection for the next 90 days across the top 5 with the most reported confirmed cases are shown in illustration 4. if no control measures are put in place , it is expected that over 40,000 would be infected in tehran around the middle of june . however , if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success , one would expect the spread of the cov-19 virus would peak at the start of april with a downward trend dropping off by the end of may ( 70 days ) . in the scenario , that no further measures are implemented , one would expect the spread of covid-19 to continue on a gentle incline , reaching 21,000 by mid-june . . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv

base model shown in illustration 5 is the simple forecast model , without trend or seasonality built-in . it has the highest aic out of the three models across the 5 sampled provinces , although it has a low mape , when compared to the other three statistical metrics like rmse , mae , mase it yields the highest margin of error in the group . the quality of the predictive model for tehran is acceptable because the dataset is more robust compared to one integrated with seasonality . the mean absolute scaled error , mase is less than 1 for the projected 90 days period which is a positive score for the model . the rmse , unbiased forecast score is slightly higher than the mae , which gives a median future distribution of 84. the mape is over 100 % which means the errors are `` much greater '' then the actual values . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . is the (

of covid-19 shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing . contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be haves this one . this is because , the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person . disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing . in addition , many factors are

so on . this article strived to analyze the growth trend of the number of patients , deaths and patients recovered in some provinces of iran . the knowledge gained can help health planners and planners . combining the findings of this study with other countries ' studies can help to extract a global pattern for the virus outbreak process analysis . we believe that there are still many factors that can be included in the study . adding these factors helps to validate and consolidate the . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder , who has granted

       "3  all dynamic processes that take place on dna in the nucleus occur in the context of a chromatin landscape that comprises nucleosomes and their modifications , transcription factors and chromatin-associated complexes . a variety of chromatin features mark sites of transcriptional regulatory elements and regions of activation and silencing that differ between cell types and change during development and disease progression . the mapping of chromatin features genome-wide has traditionally been performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) , in which chromatin is cross-linked and solubilized and an antibody to a protein or modification of interest is used to immunoprecipitate the bound dna ( rodriguez-ubreva and ballestar , 2014 ) . however , alternative chromatin profiling methods based on enzyme tethering in situ have recently gained in popularity . for example , in cleavage under targets & release using nuclease ( cut & run ) ( skene and henikoff , 2017 ) , which is based on laemmli 's chromatin immunocleavage ( chic ) method ( schmid et al. , 2004 ) , a fusion protein between micrococcal nuclease ( mnase ) and protein a binds sites of antibody binding in nuclei or permeabilized cells bound to magnetic beads . activation of mnase with ca ++ results in targeted cleavage releasing the antibody-bound fragment into the supernatant for paired-end dna sequencing . the low backgrounds resulting from antibody-tethered cleavage and release reduce cell numbers and sequencing depths required to map chromatin features relative to chip-seq , and cut & run is now becoming a standard tool for mapping transcription factors and other chromatin features ( hainer et al. , 2019 ; liu et al. , 2018 ; oomen et al. , 2019 ; roth et al. , 2018 ) . more recently , we substituted the tn5 transposase for mnase in a modified cut & run protocol , such that addition of mg ++ results in a cut-and-paste `` tagmentation '' reaction , in which sequencing adapters are integrated around sites of antibody binding ( kaya-okur et al. , 2019 ) . in cut & tag , dna purification is followed by pcr amplification , eliminating the end-polishing and ligation steps required for sequencing library preparation in cut & run . like cut & run , cut & tag requires relatively little input material , and the low backgrounds permit low sequencing depths to sensitively map chromatin features . because integrated pa-tn5 is not released following the tagmentation reaction , cut & tag and related methods are suitable for single-cell profiling , in which all steps through tagmentation are performed in a single in situ reaction , after which single cells or nuclei are dispensed for barcoding pcr amplification . the major practical advantage of cut & tag over other methods is that it eliminates the time and expense of preparing sequencing libraries , but cut & tag also has other important advantages that may make it the protocol of choice for most chromatin profiling applications . cut & tag has improved signal-to-noise for histone marks , at least in part because an antibody-tethered tn5 integrates its mosaic-end adapters and remains bound during the incubation ( kaya-okur et al. , 2019 ) . we also found that cut & tag is somewhat more efficient than cut & run , likely because integration by targeted tn5 is more efficient than enzymatic end-polishing and ligation in traditional library preparation steps . here we describe an at-home version of cut & tag in which all steps from mixing of native or lightly cross-linked nuclei with magnetic beads to post-pcr purification are performed in a single tube . this simplification of cut & tag requires only pipettors , a mini-centrifuge , a tube rotator , a pcr machine and disposable pipette tips , tubes and reagents to produce high-quality genome chromatin profiling data . during the covid-19 physical distancing restrictions in seattle we performed cut & tag @ home for 16-32 samples per day with uniformly high quality for chromatin marks of active regulatory elements , gene bodies , polycomb-silenced regions and constitutive heterochromatin . the low cell number requirements and read depths of cut & tag @ home enable home-bound researchers to produce ready-for-sequencing barcoded libraries with relatively little technical expertise , effort or cost . the basic cut & tag method is schematized in figure 1 . our simplified protocol applies to any chromatin feature for which an antibody is available and should be adaptable to any cell type for which there is a standard nuclei isolation protocol . in brief , native or lightly cross-linked nuclei are prepared and immobilized on magnetic beads . beads are incubated with a primary antibody followed by incubation with a secondary antibody to increase the number of igg molecules at each epitope bound by the primary antibody . beads are washed and incubated with protein a-tn5 loaded with mosaic-end adapters and washed under stringent conditions . tn5 is activated by addition of mg 2+ , a `` one-and-done '' reaction in that the pa-tn5 transposome is not active once it integrates its adapters . dna is released in a small volume of sds and then mixed with triton-x100 to neutralize the sds . samples are enriched by pcr amplification and a single solid phase reversible immobilization ( spri ) magnetic bead cleanup step . up to 48 barcoded libraries from multiple experiments may be pooled for each lane of a 2-lane flow cell , as 3 million mapped paired-end reads are usually sufficient for a genome-wide profile of a histone modification in human cells . cut & tag @ home is performed on frozen nuclei using non-toxic materials , and has minimal equipment requirements , so that it can be conveniently performed in a utility area on ~1.5 meters of counter space ( figure 2 ) . the cut & tag @ home protocol is also available from protocols.io ( https : //www.protocols.io/view/cut-amptag-home-bd26i8he ) , where users can added antibody ( green ) binds to the target chromatin protein ( blue ) between nucleosomes ( gray ovals ) in the genome , and the excess is washed away . a second antibody ( orange ) is added and enhances tethering of pa-tn5 transposome ( gray boxes ) at antibody-bound sites . after washing away excess transposome , addition of mg++ activates the transposome and integrates adapters ( red ) at chromatin protein binding sites . genomic fragments with adapters at both ends are released and enriched by pcr . b ) cut & tag is performed on a solid support . unfixed cells or nuclei ( blue ) are permeabilized and mixed with antibody to a target chromatin protein . after addition and binding of cells to concanavalin a-coated magnetic beads ( m ) , all further steps are performed in the same reaction tube with magnetic capture between washes and incubations , including pa-tn5 tethering , integration , and dna purification

use of a rapid cycler with a higher ramping rate will require either reducing the ramping time or other adjustments to assure annealing . tip : do not add extra pcr cycles to see a signal by capillary gel electrophoresis ( e.g . tapestation ) . if there is no nucleosomal ladder for the h3k27me3 positive control , you may assume that cut & tag failed , but observing no signal for a sparse chromatin protein such as a transcription factor is normal , and the barcoded sample can be concentrated for mixing with the pool of barcoded samples for sequencing . extra pcr cycles reduce the complexity of

be used on cut & tag data . • analysis tools designed specifically for cut & run/tag data include the seacr peak caller ( meers et al. , 2019 ) also available as a public web server ( https : //seacr.fredhutch.org ) , cut & runtools ( zhu et al. , 2019 ) and henipipe ( https : //github.com/scfurl/henipipe ) . we have developed a streamlined version of cut & tag that eliminates dna extraction , so that all steps can be performed in a single pcr tube ( kaya-okur et al. , 2020 ) . cut & tag @ home uses the same protocol , which allowed for a direct comparison of inlab to at-home implementation . to ascertain the ability of this cut & tag direct-to-pcr protocol to produce dna sequencing libraries in our home laundry/utility room , we used frozen aliquots of native human k562 cell nuclei prepared in the laboratory and profiled there using the streamlined single-tube protocol . aliquots of nuclei were thawed and serially diluted in wash buffer from ~60,000 down to ~60 starting cells , where the average yield of nuclei was ~50 % . we used antibodies to h3k27me3 , which marks nucleosomes within broad domains of polycomb-dependent silencing , and h3k4me3 , which preferentially marks nucleosomes immediately downstream of active promoters . aliquots of nuclei were taken home and stored in our kitchen freezer , then thawed and diluted at home , and profiled for h3k27me3 and h3k4me3 . in both the laboratory and at home we performed all steps in groups of 16 or 32 samples over the course of a single day , treating all samples the same regardless of cell

steps in the laboratory prior to dna sequencing . a total of 160 cut & tag @ home libraries were sequenced by the fred hutch genomics shared resource on three two-lane pe25 illumina flow-cells runs for an estimated cost of ~ $ 50 per sample for materials and sequencing . examples of tapestation profiles of libraries produced at home detects nucleosomal ladders down to 200 cells for h3k27me3 and nucleosomeal and subnucleosomal fragments for h3k4me3 ( fig . 4 ) . sequenced fragments were aligned to the human genome using bowtie2 and tracks were displayed using igv . similar results were obtained for both athome and in-lab profiles for both histone modifications ( fig . 5 ) using pa-tn5 produced in the laboratory , and results using a commercial protein a/g-tn5 were at least as good . however , the results for 60 starting cells were sparser than our published results for h3k27me3 using permeabilized cells with proteinase k digestion and spri bead extraction of tagmented dna . the lower yields using the singletube nuclei protocol could be due to losses during the nuclei preparation and/or reduction in efficiency during pcr in situ or other differences between the protocols . to illustrate the utility of our simple chromatin profiling approach , we chose antibodies to one dimethylated and four tri-methylated lysines on the nterminal tail of histone h3 that mark distinct chromatin features genome-wide . h3k4me3 preferentially marks nucleosomes immediately downstream of gene promoters and h3k4me2 also marks enhancers , h3k36me3 marks gene bodies , h3k27me3 marks regions of polycomb developmental silencing ( facultative heterochromatin ) and h3k9me3 marks regions of constitutive heterochromatin . a representative region is shown ( figure 6 ) , with selected comparisons to illustrate specific chromatin features . a comparison between h3k4me2 and h3k4me3 shows the active housekeeping strip2 promoter marked by h3k4me3 and an enhancer just downstream marked by both modifications . these functional inferences are supported by an atacseq track , which shows that both sites are accessible to tn5 and by sure ( survey of regulatory elements ) , a massively parallel reporter survey for autonomous active regulatory elements in k562 cells ( van arensbergen et al. , 2017 ) . further downstream the strip2 gene body is heavily marked by h3k36me3 , in contrast

where there is strong h3k4 di-and tri-methylation , but very little gene-body h3k36me3 . this example illustrates the rich gene regulatory information that can be obtained by cut & tag . to extend these observations to a genomic scale , we aligned the four h3 lysine trimethylation datasets to transcriptional start sites and produced heatmaps ordered by signal intensity over ±10 kb intervals . as expected , the h3k4me3 peak lies just downstream of the promoter , showing very little overlap with h3k36me3 , confirmed by average plots of these marks normalized to the genome ( fig . 7a ) . a comparison between h3k27me3 and h3k9me3 cut & tag tracks suggests that these two silencing marks are non-overlapping ( fig . 6 ) . interestingly , in the highlighted example , a strong peak of h3k9me3

erv from the h3 lysine trimethylation tracks over chromosome 1 , which harbors 50,707 of the 695,067 human ervs , from the ucsc repeat masker file . we stacked the segments ordered by decreasing length of the erv ( fig . 7b ) . for h3k4me3 , h3k36me3 and h3k27me3 we observed essentially no signal over these elements , whereas for h3k9me3 we observed signal over elements of all sizes , including a cluster of heavily h3k9me3-marked erv fragments spanning ~2 kb in length . this observation is consistent with studies showing that intact and active ervs are among the most heavily h3k9me3-methylated elements in mammalian genomes ( bulut-karslioglu et al. , 2014 ; ohtani et al. , 2018 ; walter et al. , 2016 ) . to determine whether there are any differences among the erv families in the propensity for gaining h3k9 trimethylation , we performed unsupervised k-means clustering over a ±1 kb span on the full set of chromosome 1 ervs ( k=3 ) . cluster i comprises 5,536 heavily h3k9trimethylated ervs ( 11 % ) and cluster iii comprises 31,177 ervs ( 62 % ) with background levels of h3k9 trimethylation ( fig 7b , rightmost panel ) . among the erv families , ervk , which accounts for 8 % of the total human ervs , was on average 2.8-fold more highly represented in cluster i relative to cluster iii ( 186:382 ) than were all other ervs ( 5350:30795 ) . the ervk family is the youngest and most intact of the human endogenous retrovirus families ( hanke et al. , 2016 ) , and in the mouse male germline , members of the ervk family were specifically reactivated upon loss of a germline- figure 6 : cut & tag @ home segments the human epigenome with four h3 lysine trimethylation marks : screenshot of a representative 1 mb region of the human genome showing cut

ervk in the heavily h3k9-trimethylated class is consistent with a role for this modification in maintaining genome integrity by suppression of endogenous retroviral proliferation . we conclude that five cut & tag @ home histone h3 methylation profiles segment the human genome at high-resolution into active promoters , enhancers , gene bodies , developmentally silenced domains and constitutively silenced endogenous retroviruses . whereas chromatin accessibility profiling maps only enhancers and promoters without distinguishing between them ( e.g . the atac-seq track in figure 5 ) , cut & tag using histone methylation antibodies captures the extraordinary richness of the full epigenome . we previously introduced cut & tag for efficient low-cost genome-wide chromatin profiling and showed that it provides high-resolution profiles for epitopes on nucleosomes , transcription factors and rna polymerase ii with especially low signal-to-noise fig . 7 : h3 lysine trimethylation data aligned

profile , but also in the read-out platforms it is suitable for , including in plate format for low-cell-number samples and nanowell dispensing for on the order of 1000 single cells . since our original cut & tag publication in april , 2019 , we have distributed > 600 pa-tn5 aliquots to laboratories around the world , and during that time our original protocol has been the most popular of the ~6000 protocols on protocols.io ( lenny teytelman , personal communication ) . because cut & tag requires that cells or nuclei remain intact throughout the procedure , there are no harsh treatments or toxic chemicals required , which makes the protocol inherently safe and appropriate for being performed in a home utility area . therefore , we expect that cut & tag @ home will be welcomed by a substantial cohort of users , whether they are able to work in the lab or can only work at home subject to covid-19 restrictions . cut & tag @ home implements a streamlined version of the bench-top protocol that allows for chromatin profiling without tube transfers from nuclei to purified sequencing-ready barcoded libraries ( kaya-okur et al. , 2020 ) . elimination of the dna purification steps of cut & tag allows all operations from mixing of nuclei with magnetic beads to final library purification to be performed entirely by successive treatments of bead-bound nuclei in a single pcr tube . this protocol can be performed on as many as 32 samples in a single day with starting cell numbers ranging from < 100 to ~100,000 . we have extended the versatility of this streamlined cut & tag protocol by demonstrating that it can be performed with minor equipment , reagent and supply needs using materials borrowed from the lab or purchased online and delivered . this enables researchers , students and others with little hands-on laboratory experience to perform chromatin profiling at home . although we do not expect that quantification , quality control and pooling of barcoded samples and sequencing to be also done at home , these services are likely to be available at many commercial and academic facilities , even during the covid-19 crisis . in the longer term , we expect that the simplicity of our cut & tag @ home protocol makes it just as suitable for the lab bench as it is for the laundry room . epicypher 13-0027 ; h3k4me3 : active motif

       "4  the world is facing an unprecedented health crisis affecting nearly all parts of society . in these times , access to the most state-of-the-art scientific knowledge is paramount to tackling the crisis . academic journals and scholarly publishers are hence called upon to make new knowledge openly available and deliver new insights quickly . in the current covid-19 era , it is clear that new knowledge is direly needed . scientists all over the world have stepped in to do experiments , observational studies and new analyses as to obtain relevant information . however fast we would like to have access to this information , the scientific method used to obtain it , requires time . drug trials and vaccine creations do not happen overnight ( thorp , 2020 ) . however , once such information has been gathered , it needs to be disseminated to all those potentially in the position to use it , as quick as possible . traditionally , scholarly journals have been one of the main outlets to facilitate this ( horbach & halffman , 2018 ) . one of the factors hindering quick delivery of new information through scholarly journals is the duration of their publication process . through editorial assessment and peer review , journals select which articles deserve to be published on their pages , ideally filtering out invalid , erroneous or otherwise problematic research . even though celebrated as being one of the hallmarks of science , the editorial process is also regularly criticized . commentators blame it for being inconsistent ( peters & ceci , 1982 ) , essentially flawed ( smith , 2006 ) , biased ( teplitskiy , acuna , elamrani-raoult , körding , & evans , 2018 ) , andparticularly relevant in these times of crisis -slow ( nguyen et al. , 2015 ) . several studies have previously aimed to assess the typical duration of journals ' publication process ( lin , hou , & wu , 2016 ; tosi , 2009 ) . in their analyses , researchers commonly distinguish two stages of this process : the review stage ( i.e . the stage between article submission and formal acceptance ) and the editorial stage ( i.e . the stage between acceptance and final publication , either online or in print ) . in a meta-analysis including over 2700 journal articles , björk and solomon ( 2013 ) find considerable differences in turnaround times ( i.e . the period between submission and publication of a journal article , sometimes also called 'publication delays ' ) between research disciplines . for biomedical journals , they find an average duration of the review stage of just over four months , while the editorial stage takes on average about five months . clearly , such turnaround times are highly undesirable in light of the current health crisis . two major responses to circumvent long turnaround times can currently be witnessed . from an author perspective , commentators are reporting a sharp increase in the use of preprint servers . on these online platforms , authors upload their manuscript , making it publicly accessible immediately upon finalization of the text ( gunnarsdottir , 2005 ) . because no review , editorial assessment or copyediting takes place , manuscripts can be made accessible without publication delay . however , as manuscripts are only reviewed once they are available for anybody to read and use , scholars warn for potentially incorrect results spreading without editorial assessment filtering them . in fact , several cases of invalid research regarding covid-19 being published as preprints have already been reported ( heimstädt , 2020 ; marcus & oransky , 2020 ) . it should be noted though that this is not specific to preprints , as journal articles can require from post-publication corrections and retractions as well ( horbach & halffman , 2019 ) . several articles related to covid-19 have already gone through this process ( gautret et al. , 2020 ) . from the publishers ' side , several journals and publishers are currently modifying their editorial procedures and policies to warrant fast dissemination of relevant information . for instance , elife announced it would curtail requests for additional experiments during revisions , suspend its deadline for submitting revisions , make the posting of preprints to biorxiv or medrxiv the default for all elife submissions , and it would specifically mobilize early-career researchers to become reviewing editors and reviewers in order to extent the journal 's reviewer pool ( eisen , akhmanova , behrens , & weigel , 2020 ) . similarly , nature put out an open invitation to researchers with relevant expertise to review covid-19 related papers over short time ( `` coronavirus pandemic : nature 's pledge to you , '' 2020 ) . hence , journals and publishers are aiming to attract reviewers that can assist in the rapid publication of new findings , relevant to tackle the health crisis . the medical journal of australia ( mja ) has drafted policies related to both preprints are rapid peer review , setting up 'fast lanes ' for covid-19 related research : '' the mja has stepped up to play its part in meeting this crisis , including ultra-rapid review of sars-cov-2 manuscripts and pre-print publication of unedited papers , to ensure that the newest data and viewpoints are available as soon as possible . '' ( talley , 2020 ) the royal society open publishing announced to establish a similar fast lane for their registered reports on covid-19 related content . they have even gathered a group of 700 reviewers who have committed to review a paper in 24 to 48 hours when called up on ( brock , 2020 ) . the journal also acknowledges one of the major concerns related to these fast dissemination models : `` the ultra-rapid review and publication model entails a risk of error , but sharing important information too slowly is a much greater hazard . '' ( talley , 2020 ) in this article , we assess whether the scholarly publishing community succeeds in speeding up the dissemination of covid-19 related content . to do so , we assess the use of preprint servers , the uptake of preprint articles in academic journals , and the duration of journals ' publication process both prior to and during the present pandemic . for our analysis , we use a repository of covid-19 related research articles established by the centre for science and technology studies ( cwts ) . the repository is based on databases of cord19 , dimensions and the world health organisation ( who ) , and includes articles on covid-19 , sars-cov-2 , and related ( corona ) viruses and infectious diseases . in particular , this means that the database contains journal articles and preprints that predate the current covid-19 pandemic , as it for instance also includes articles on the 2002 sars virus and disease . for brevity 's sake , all such articles will in the remainder of this article by described as 'covid-19 related ' articles . a full description of the database as well as access to all relevant data is available ( cwts , 2020 ) . colavizza et al . ( 2020 ) provide a description and analysis of parts of this database . all results in this article are based on the april 4 release of the database . we note that the majority of articles in the dataset originates from the cord19 database . some doubt has been raised about the relevance of some of this database 's articles to the current pandemic ( colavizza et al. , 2020 ) , but for our purposes , the scope of the database seems reasonable . based on this dataset , several analyses were performed : we analysed the duration of the publication process , in number of days , for a sample of 529 journal articles . 259 articles were published during the present pandemic ( i.e . from jan 1 , 2020 ) and 270 were published prior to the pandemic ( i.e . before oct 1 , 2019 ) . the articles were published in 14 different journals . journals were selected based on their number of articles both prior to and during the current pandemic as well as the availability of data on when articles were submitted , accepted and published . we selected the ten journals publishing most covid-19 related articles in general , supplemented by the five journals publishing most covid-19 related content since the start of the pandemic , that make publication data ( submission , acceptance and publish ) available . one journal , viruses , matches both criteria . the list of journals used in this analysis , including their number of articles , as well as the journals discarded because no data on submission , acceptance or publication dates was available , is added as supplementary material a. from those journals , we sampled all articles published since the start of the pandemic and matched those to an equal number of articles published in the same journal prior to the pandemic to form a control group . in case the control group had fewer articles , we used this number of articles and only selected the most recent articles after the pandemic . in case less than ten articles were published since the start of the pandemic , we nonetheless sampled ten articles for the control group . for the control group , we sampled articles starting with publications in 2019 ( but before oct 1 st ) and moving backwards , in order to make sure editorial policies most closely resemble those in the pandemic . table 1 presents the list of journals used , including the number of articles sampled per journal . information on the dates of submission , acceptance and publication was manually retrieved from the journal 's webpage . in case journals distinguished between publication online and appearance in the print issue of the journal , we selected the date of online publication . to control for potential effects specific to covid-19 related papers , we selected , for all journals in our sample , the ten most recently published articles ( as of april 16 th , 2020 ) about non-covid-19 related content . in particular , these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning covid-19 , coronavirus , sars-cov-2 , or cov-19 in their title , keywords and abstract . all the 140 articles in this control group were published during the current pandemic , with 64 % published in april 2020 , 32 % in march , 1 % in february , and 3 % in january . we assessed the usage of preprint servers as a fast way of disseminating academic knowledge by counting the number of preprints on covid-19 related content both during and before the current pandemic . for this we used all preprints in de database , and did use a more narrow sampling strategy . hence , we include all covid-19 related preprints . in addition , we analysed the number of preprints that also appeared as journal articles , and the average number of days between publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article . the analysis is based on the linkage of preprints and journal articles in the dimensions database ( https : //docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/index.html ) . figure 2 compares the overall duration of journals ' publication process prior to and during the present pandemic . it demonstrates that , on average , journals have drastically increased the speed of their processes for covid-19 publications : average turnaround times in our journal sample has decreased from 117 to 60 days . comparing the 95 % confidence intervals of both statistics , shows the decrease to be highly substantial and significant . the copyright holder for this preprint ( which was not peer-reviewed ) is the . table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the average duration of the publication process for covid-19 related articles in journals in our sample . it distinguishes between the periods before and during the pandemic and it splits the entire publication process in the review stage ( between submission and acceptance ) and editorial stage ( between acceptance and submission ) . figure 3 presents a graphical overview of the average decrease in turnaround time in the period during the crisis compared to the period prior to the pandemic . it again distinguishes between the review and editorial stages of the publication process . note that negative numbers in this case indicate an increase in turnaround time . the figure indicates the review stage shortens for ten out of the fourteen journals in our sample , while nine journals managed to shorten their editorial stage . average acceleration is around 50 % for both stages , but it goes up to nearly 100 % in some journals . to check whether the acceleration of publication processes is specific to covid-19 related papers , we analysed the turnaround times for non-covid-19 related articles published since the start of the pandemic . for all journals in our sample , we selected the ten most recently published articles ( as of april 16 th , 2020 ) about non-covid-19 related content . in particular , these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning covid-19 , coronavirus , sars-cov-2 , or cov-19 in their title , keywords and abstract . for these articles we also analysed the turnaround times of their publication process . results are presented in figure 4 . the figure indicates that for most journals , articles not related to covid-19 have very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic . unpacking the publication process in the review and editorial stage , we conclude that , again , non-covid-19 related articles follow a very similar pattern to articles published before the pandemic . some of the most prominent , high impact medical journals are not part of our sample , because they do not share all relevant data on submission , acceptance and publication dates . comparing the total number of published articles in high impact journals such as bmj , the lancet , jama and nejm does not give a clear indication of faster publication : these four journals published 864 , 421 , 351 , and 307 articles respectively in 2020 , according to a web of science search . over the same period in 2019 they published 874 , 497 , 335 , and 334 articles respectively . hence , most show a small decrease in the total number of published articles . consequently , if they managed to speed up their publication process for covid-19 related articles , this has gone at the expense of other content being published less , or less quickly . next we turn our analysis towards the publication of preprints . as was shown in figure 1 , the number of preprints on covid-19 related content has seen a sharp increase since the outbreak of the pandemic . in total 2102 preprints were published on seven preprint servers : ssrn electronic journal , biorxiv , chemrxiv , jmir preprints , research square , and medrxiv . we note that even though arxiv publications are included in the dimensions database , they are not included in the 4 april release of the dataset we used , due to technical issues . out of the 2102 preprints in our dataset , 129 have currently also appeared as journal article . due to the small number of preprints appearing as journal articles , no statistically relevant conclusions can be drawn about the uptake of preprints in journals . however , analyse the average duration between the publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article we see a steady increase , ranging from , on average , 137 days in 2017 and just over 200 days in 2020. currently , we do not see any indication of acceleration of the uptake of preprints in journals since the outbreak of all but one of these preprint-journal article pairs were published prior to the current pandemic . however , comparing the results in tables 1 and 2 , it becomes clear that turnaround times for articles that previously appeared as preprints are much shorter than the average turnaround times in these journals . in fact , for these pre-pandemic articles , turnaround times are even shorter than their postpandemic counterparts . our analysis indicates that the scholarly publishing enterprise has managed to drastically speed up the dissemination of covid-19 related research material since the outbreak of the pandemic . in particular , academic journals managed to decrease the duration of their publication process by 49 % , or 57 days on average , which is a statistically relevant difference . some journals even show a decrease in publication time of over 80 % compared to the pre-crisis era . this acceleration concerns both the stage of review ( between submission and acceptance ) and the editing stage ( between acceptance and publication ) . the journals in our sample shortened both stages by 47 % ( 45 days ) and 61 % ( 14 days ) respectively . hence the majority of the decrease in total publication time is due to speeding up the review process . we also conclude that the acceleration of the publication process is specific to covid-19 related articles . articles not related to covid-19 published during the pandemic show very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic . in addition to a fast spread of information through journal articles , the number of papers submitted to preprint servers has drastically increased . however , such preprints do not seem to be taken up as journal publications any quicker than they were before the covid-19 pandemic . nevertheless , articles first appearing as preprints do seem to go through shorter publication processes than articles not appearing as preprints . to tackle the current health crisis , many have urged to disseminate relevant academic knowledge as fast as possible . acknowledging that typical publication delays in medical journals are unacceptable in the current era , journals are expected to decrease the turnaround times of their publication process . the results of our study indicate that journals have indeed managed to do so . our results on the average turnaround times of journal articles prior to the current pandemic corresponds well with earlier findings of studies on publication delays in medical journals ( björk & solomon , 2013 ) . however , since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic , medical journals have managed to drastically accelerate their publication process to make it nearly twice as fast for covid-19 related articles . on the contrary , articles not related to covid-19 that were published since the beginning of the pandemic , do not show any acceleration . their turnaround times are similar to articles published before the pandemic . while it seems reasonable that journals might encounter difficulties to attract reviewers with relevant expertise -since those are probably active scientists working on novel research themselves -the contrary seems to be the case . concluding from our results , it seems that journals are finding enough reviewers willing to review covid-19 related papers on a very short notice . however , this conclusion should be treated with caution , as no data is available on who reviewed the papers . maybe the same few experts reviewed a lot more than usual ; maybe 'relevant expertise ' was taken as a relative criterion , with journals using reviewers that usually would not have counted as experts . the fact that non-covid-19 related papers are published at similar speeds during and before the pandemic , seems to indicate that journals are also not facing more issues with attracting reviewers for those papers . as preprint articles are not being included in medical journals more quickly , it seems that either authors are not submitting preprint articles to journals more quickly , or journals are prioritizing content that has not appeared as preprint . qualitative follow-up research interviewing authors and editors on their submission and review practices regarding preprint articles could shed further light on this . even though the acceleration of journals ' publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination , it also raises several questions and concerns . first , one could wonder whether faster is always better . even though the two do not necessarily exclude each other , it seems reasonable that there is a balance , or perhaps even a trade-off , between speed and quality in peer review . especially concerning the stage of review , legitimate concerns can be raised on whether speeding up the review process might harm the process ' ability to filter incorrect or invalid findings . such research slipping through peer review , might require corrections or retractions in the future . given the potentially rapid uptake of medical knowledge in policy and clinical contexts , such corrections might come in too late as potential harm might have already been done . commentators have raised this concern regarding the usage of information in preprints , but it similarly applies to journal articles . in fact , false information spreading through journal articles is arguably more damaging , since it has the appearance of being 'peer reviewed ' and hence properly verified . scholars have repeatedly warned that a substantial share of articles ( hastily ) published during this crisis , will require future corrections ( marcus & oransky , 2020 ) . formal expressions of concern -on papers used to make policy decisions -have already been issued ( voss , 2020 ) . future research should therefore analyse whether shorter review processes during the covid-19 pandemic have led to an increase in corrections or retractions of published articles . while drastic acceleration of the review stage might evoke quality issues , this arguably applies less to the editorial stage of the publication process . journals ' achievement of shortening this stage of the publication process for covid-19 related content is purely laudable . however , this might raise questions about why publication delays in this stage are usually higher and whether journals will aim and be able to maintain such standards in a post-crisis era . one potential explanation for the shortened editorial stage is that publishers or journal editors now prioritize covid-19 related research articles , at the expense of other articles . however , our data on non-covid-19 related articles published during the pandemic seems to contradict this . it seems like journals are managing to speed up editorial work for covid-19 related content , while maintaining standards for other articles . several journals show a substantial lengthening of the editorial stage . this might be caused by an increase in the number of manuscripts submitted to the respective journals . for journals showing an increase in total turnaround time , this seems to be concentrated in the editorial process . since editors themselves might be practicing scientists , the overload of newly submitted manuscripts might be a cause of this additional delay . this study potentially suffers from various limitations in its analysis . first , it could only analyse those journal articles that have been published . this particularly implies that it was unable to assess the review process ' duration for rejected articles . neither could it analyse articles that are currently still under review . second , the analysis does not include article type as a feature of analysis . some article types , including letters to the editor , perspectives or commentaries , might undergo a different kind of peer reviewthey might for instance only be reviewed by the editor , rather than by external reviewers . a potential difference in distribution of pre-and post-crisis articles over the various article types might explain some of the variation in the publication process ' duration . third , our analyses focus on journals publishing relatively many covid-19 related articles . due to a lack of sufficient articles in other , potentially smaller journals , we were not able to analyse those journals . as larger journals may more easily attract reviewers and have more resources , and hence more capacity to shift resources , to execute the editorial stage of publication , the resulting decrease in publication time might be less strong in smaller journals . at a later stage , when more covid-19 related papers appear in other journals , future research could verify this potential difference . last , it should be noted that some of the journal articles assigned to our control group concern papers related to previous health crises or pandemics such as the mesh , ebola or zika crises . despite similar incentives to publish those articles quickly , content related to covid-19 makes its way through the publication process much quicker . future research could include a more elaborate comparison not only between pre-and post-covid-19 eras , but also between publishing in the covid-19 and other health related crises . in these times of crisis , the rapid dissemination of relevant academic knowledge is of paramount importance . several stakeholders have already warned for a 'fake-news pandemic ' spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories through social media channels in the absence of established . cc-by 4.0 international license author/funder . it is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint ( which was

experts , as well as to counter the spread of such disinformation , researchers and academic journals have a responsibility to share available knowledge quickly . the fact that medical journals have managed to considerably speed up their publication process for covid-19 related content during the current pandemic is therefore laudable . however , some concerns remain about whether faster dissemination might go at the expense of research quality . quickly spreading false information might do more harm than slowly spreading reliable knowledge .
