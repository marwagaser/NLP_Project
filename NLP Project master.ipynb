       "      <td>Since its emergence in December 2019 the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has become a major public threat worldwide. Immediate access to reliable up-to-date scientific information is critically important and can potentially impact outcomes for both individuals and countries alike. Experts debate the impact this pandemic will have on medical resources, such as ventilators and ICU beds, but there is little shared objective data across hospitals and primarily only anecdotal evidence exists to understand the stress our critical care system is currently under 1,2 .\\nTele-critical care networks provide a unique ability to understand current data across large networks of hospitals. The Philips eICU program aggregates data from the community of eICUs for routine benchmarking, data analytics and collaborative research 3,4 . This system provides unique access to granular, clinical data in real time, including ventilator use and dynamic severity of illness scoring [5] [6] [7] .\\nThe goal of this brief report is to describe observed changes to critical care in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic at a large network of 9 hospitals in the greater New York City (NYC) area.\\nNorthwell Health is a large health system in the greater NYC area using a tele-ICU system to provide supplementary coverage for many of its ICUs. Data integration occurs from the electronic health record and vital sign monitoring devices via HL7 interfaces. Additionally, the ICU admission diagnosis and other care plans are captured directly in the remote monitoring software. On March 23, 2020 a routine query to extract data related to unit type, patient demographics, mechanical ventilation use, severity of illness (DRS), and outcomes was installed to obtain a de-identified snapshot of each monitored ICU bed and transferred securely to Philips Healthcare for quality improvement analytics and reporting. For comparison, a query was run on a historical cohort from the same health system across all of 2019. Due to the prior reporting process requiring patients be discharged from the hospital for five days prior to analysis, we were limited in our ability to describe data in the weeks immediately prior to installing the prospective query.\\nIn order to only include ICUs using continuous monitoring, as opposed to consultative monitoring, the analysis was restricted to ICUs with at least five monitored beds. Due to the urgency of describing this data, we focused on describing global critical care needs, rather than those specific to COVID-19 patients given lack of precise method to identify COVID-19 patients in the existing data structure.\\nData were separated into pre-COVID-19 (all of 2019) and pandemic periods (March 23, 2020 to April 6, 2020). Data in the weeks immediately before the implementation of prospective data extract (1/1/2020 to 3/22/2010) were discarded due to the diminished availability of data for hospitalized and recently discharged patients. DRS was validated as a severity of illness score across the entire cohort of discharged patients by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for admission, mean, median and last DRS with ICU mortality.\\nTo describe the time-varying statistics of patients in the included ICUs, hourly patient data were summarized and compared between the pre-COVID-19 and the pandemic periods: time from ICU/hospital admission to observation time, DRS, percentage of invasive and noninvasive ventilation.\\n.

Admission DRS (highest DRS score within 24 hours of ICU admission) and discharge DRS were evaluated among the discharged patients. Means and standard deviations were compared using the two-sample t-test and repeated measures ANOVA when independence of samples cannot be assumed. Skewed continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-Square test.\\nThe expected mortality for the observed severity of illness scoring is provided through a secondary analysis of a previously reported study validating hourly assessment of 561,478 patients 7 .\\nThese data represent 186 beds from 14 ICUs in 9 hospitals. There were 10,714 patient unit stays in the pre-COVID-19 phase and 465 in the pandemic data collection period. Table 1 describes the cohort with increases in proportion of patients of Hispanic origin and male gender. Percentages of patients with a primary admission diagnosis of either viral pneumonia or pulmonary sepsis increased from 8.2% to at least 55.1%. Table 2 describes the average ICU population at any given hour during the evaluation periods. The proportion of occupied beds (64% vs. 78%; p&lt;0.01) and patients receiving invasive ventilation at any (33.9% vs. 84.2%; p&lt;0.01) given moment increased during the pandemic period. We also observe a dramatic increase in the severity of illness in the pandemic period. Validation of DRS as a marker of severity of illness across the entire cohort is presented in Table 3 . Median DRS raised from 1.08 in pre-COVID-19 group to 39.38 in the pandemic group. Historical cohorts show that patients with a median DRS of 1.08 have an average ICU mortality of approximately 3% compared with 26% for those with a median DRS of 39.38, representing a greater than 8-fold increase in mortality risk 6 . We also observe a large increase in discharge severity of illness among ICU survivors.\\nAt this time in the COVID-19 pandemic, transparency and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and preparedness. This is the first study to describe changes in occupancy, severity of illness and ventilator use during the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC area.\\nThese data provide an objective view into what previously has been described only anecdotally. Although our definition for bed occupancy is intended to reflect occupied beds at any given time, the relative increase over baseline may be more interpretable given the novelty of the metric. Most notably is a dramatic increase in severity of illness during the COVID-19 timeframe. Use of invasive ventilation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic time period consistent with the known clinical course of rapidly developing respiratory failure [8] [9] [10] . With an average of 84.2% of patients receiving invasive ventilation at any given moment, this reflects a major challenge in providing care.\\nA change in ethnic demographics, perhaps indicating greater spread of disease in Hispanic populations, was observed. A similar finding has been noted in the African American population in Michigan 11 and could reflect differing abilities for populations to socially distance, perhaps related to socioeconomic factors.\\n.

Due to expansion of available beds for treating patients during this pandemic, these data do not reflect the entire population of ICU patients, but instead reflect patients monitored using tele-critical care. It is clear ICU patients during the pandemic are dramatically sicker than those in the prior year, possibly reflecting preferential triage to monitored units. As a supplementary model of care, it's possible the reliability of certain data elements are suboptimal, especially amid the pandemic response though we observe low rates of missing data.\\nThese data provide insights into the forthcoming challenges for regions on track to experience the next outbreak, which will be important for critical care management and resource planning.\\nWe would like to thank Donna Decker, Colin McKenna, Ashley Vernon, Kurt Aglidjian and Brian Gottfried for their work to rapidly develop and deploy a system for tracking these data.

       "5  Since its emergence in December 2019 the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has become a major public threat worldwide. Immediate access to reliable up-to-date scientific information is critically important and can potentially impact outcomes for both individuals and countries alike. Experts debate the impact this pandemic will have on medical resources, such as ventilators and ICU beds, but there is little shared objective data across hospitals and primarily only anecdotal evidence exists to understand the stress our critical care system is currently under 1,2 .\\nTele-critical care networks provide a unique ability to understand current data across large networks of hospitals. The Philips eICU program aggregates data from the community of eICUs for routine benchmarking, data analytics and collaborative research 3,4 . This system provides unique access to granular, clinical data in real time, including ventilator use and dynamic severity of illness scoring [5] [6] [7] .\\nThe goal of this brief report is to describe observed changes to critical care in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic at a large network of 9 hospitals in the greater New York City (NYC) area.\\nNorthwell Health is a large health system in the greater NYC area using a tele-ICU system to provide supplementary coverage for many of its ICUs. Data integration occurs from the electronic health record and vital sign monitoring devices via HL7 interfaces. Additionally, the ICU admission diagnosis and other care plans are captured directly in the remote monitoring software. On March 23, 2020 a routine query to extract data related to unit type, patient demographics, mechanical ventilation use, severity of illness (DRS), and outcomes was installed to obtain a de-identified snapshot of each monitored ICU bed and transferred securely to Philips Healthcare for quality improvement analytics and reporting. For comparison, a query was run on a historical cohort from the same health system across all of 2019. Due to the prior reporting process requiring patients be discharged from the hospital for five days prior to analysis, we were limited in our ability to describe data in the weeks immediately prior to installing the prospective query.\\nIn order to only include ICUs using continuous monitoring, as opposed to consultative monitoring, the analysis was restricted to ICUs with at least five monitored beds. Due to the urgency of describing this data, we focused on describing global critical care needs, rather than those specific to COVID-19 patients given lack of precise method to identify COVID-19 patients in the existing data structure.\\nData were separated into pre-COVID-19 (all of 2019) and pandemic periods (March 23, 2020 to April 6, 2020). Data in the weeks immediately before the implementation of prospective data extract (1/1/2020 to 3/22/2010) were discarded due to the diminished availability of data for hospitalized and recently discharged patients. DRS was validated as a severity of illness score across the entire cohort of discharged patients by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for admission, mean, median and last DRS with ICU mortality.\\nTo describe the time-varying statistics of patients in the included ICUs, hourly patient data were summarized and compared between the pre-COVID-19 and the pandemic periods: time from ICU/hospital admission to observation time, DRS, percentage of invasive and noninvasive ventilation.\\n.

Admission DRS (highest DRS score within 24 hours of ICU admission) and discharge DRS were evaluated among the discharged patients. Means and standard deviations were compared using the two-sample t-test and repeated measures ANOVA when independence of samples cannot be assumed. Skewed continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-Square test.\\nThe expected mortality for the observed severity of illness scoring is provided through a secondary analysis of a previously reported study validating hourly assessment of 561,478 patients 7 .\\nThese data represent 186 beds from 14 ICUs in 9 hospitals. There were 10,714 patient unit stays in the pre-COVID-19 phase and 465 in the pandemic data collection period. Table 1 describes the cohort with increases in proportion of patients of Hispanic origin and male gender. Percentages of patients with a primary admission diagnosis of either viral pneumonia or pulmonary sepsis increased from 8.2% to at least 55.1%. Table 2 describes the average ICU population at any given hour during the evaluation periods. The proportion of occupied beds (64% vs. 78%; p<0.01) and patients receiving invasive ventilation at any (33.9% vs. 84.2%; p<0.01) given moment increased during the pandemic period. We also observe a dramatic increase in the severity of illness in the pandemic period. Validation of DRS as a marker of severity of illness across the entire cohort is presented in Table 3 . Median DRS raised from 1.08 in pre-COVID-19 group to 39.38 in the pandemic group. Historical cohorts show that patients with a median DRS of 1.08 have an average ICU mortality of approximately 3% compared with 26% for those with a median DRS of 39.38, representing a greater than 8-fold increase in mortality risk 6 . We also observe a large increase in discharge severity of illness among ICU survivors.\\nAt this time in the COVID-19 pandemic, transparency and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and preparedness. This is the first study to describe changes in occupancy, severity of illness and ventilator use during the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC area.\\nThese data provide an objective view into what previously has been described only anecdotally. Although our definition for bed occupancy is intended to reflect occupied beds at any given time, the relative increase over baseline may be more interpretable given the novelty of the metric. Most notably is a dramatic increase in severity of illness during the COVID-19 timeframe. Use of invasive ventilation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic time period consistent with the known clinical course of rapidly developing respiratory failure [8] [9] [10] . With an average of 84.2% of patients receiving invasive ventilation at any given moment, this reflects a major challenge in providing care.\\nA change in ethnic demographics, perhaps indicating greater spread of disease in Hispanic populations, was observed. A similar finding has been noted in the African American population in Michigan 11 and could reflect differing abilities for populations to socially distance, perhaps related to socioeconomic factors.\\n.

Due to expansion of available beds for treating patients during this pandemic, these data do not reflect the entire population of ICU patients, but instead reflect patients monitored using tele-critical care. It is clear ICU patients during the pandemic are dramatically sicker than those in the prior year, possibly reflecting preferential triage to monitored units. As a supplementary model of care, it's possible the reliability of certain data elements are suboptimal, especially amid the pandemic response though we observe low rates of missing data.\\nThese data provide insights into the forthcoming challenges for regions on track to experience the next outbreak, which will be important for critical care management and resource planning.\\nWe would like to thank Donna Decker, Colin McKenna, Ashley Vernon, Kurt Aglidjian and Brian Gottfried for their work to rapidly develop and deploy a system for tracking these data.

       "      <td>Evidence from prior pandemics suggests that, along with the direct consequences of the infection itself, the public health impact can also be profound from a psychiatric perspective. As with any traumatic event, the acute stressor can be associated with increases in anxiety and depression, among other psychiatric symptoms 12 .\\nWhile the emergence of the worldwide coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been characterized in near-real-time, less is known about its impact on psychiatric care, particularly in the United States. Reviews suggest that beyond fear of the pandemic itself, containment strategies such as quarantine can also have profound effects 3 . Multiple surveys suggest significant prevalence of depression and anxiety among health care workers responding to COVID-19 in Wuhan, and China more broadly 45 . Web-based surveys 6 likewise find broad prevalence of such symptoms in less selected populations in China. In the United Kingdom, more than 60% of adults endorsed anxiety or worry 7 in a recent survey, and in the United States, ~1/3 of surveyed individuals reported COVID-19 had impacted their mental health 8 .\\nParticularly given constraints on ability to provide direct patient care imposed by quarantines and resource limitations, understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on provision of psychiatric care is critical. To date, many more individuals have been impacted by the fear of the pandemic and consequences of quarantine than by infection itself. Moreover, insofar as acute symptoms likely predict risk for longer-term sequelae such as posttraumatic stress syndrome, the ability to address such symptoms may have implications for efforts to anticipate and potentially reduce such sequelae 910 .\\n.

We examined both outpatient and emergency room settings, describing prevalence of these symptoms since January 2, 2020, as the pandemic emerged in the northeast United States. Specifically, we sought to understand how documentation of psychiatric symptoms changed as disease activity increased in Eastern Massachusetts, and whether presence of documented psychiatric symptoms was associated with greater or lesser probability of COVID-19 testing.\\nThe cohort included all individuals seen in outpatient visits or emergency rooms across 2 academic medical centers and 3 community affiliate hospitals between January 2, 2019 and March 25, 2020. Narrative clinical notes for all visits were extracted from the electronic health record serving all of these sites. Sociodemographic data including age, sex, race, and ethnicity were also drawn from the electronic health record. Presence of a coronavirus test was determined from the enterprise laboratory feed (LOINC:94309-2). All data were extracted from the Partners Research Patient Data Registry 11 and managed as an i2b2 datamart. 12 The Partners HealthCare Human Research Committee approved the study protocol.

These estimated RDoC domain scores have been validated against clinician review, and shown to predict longitudinal outcomes among psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations 14, 15 . For the present study, token lists were drawn from the appropriate domain(s) to reflect depression, anxiety, suicide, and psychosis. While not necessarily reflecting psychiatric symptoms, tokens capturing violence were also drawn from this set.\\nEach of the 2 cohorts, reflecting a single treatment setting, was analyzed individually.\\nPrimary descriptive analysis sought to capture volume of documentation by individual symptoms by day, based upon all notes, in comparison with volume of COVID-19 testing.\\nLogistic regression was used to examine the relationship between presence of coronavirus testing in the month of March (i.e., after testing was initiated) and individual psychiatric tokens, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

(Sensitivity analysis considering one randomly-selected note per individual, or index note, did not yield meaningfully different results and are not presented here, consistent with previous work using narrative notes in this health system; see, e.g., McCoy 14 .) All analyses utilized R 3.6.0 16 . provide insight regarding magnitude of subsequent decrease in visit frequency. Notes with mentions of anxiety dropped 75% for outpatient and 45% for ED from a weekly average in January and February, excluding holidays, to the week spanning 3/19/2020-3/25/2020 (decrease from 96,280 to 24,113 outpatient notes and 3,533 to 1,940, respectively). A similar decrease was observed for mentions of depression with a drop of 81% for outpatient and 44% for ED (decrease from 49,132 to 9,315 outpatient notes and 1,446 to 816, respectively). Similarly, Figure 1 (C) shows references to suicide, overdose, and violence, illustrating a similar pattern. For comparison, Figure 2 shows relative stability of age by week.\\n.

In the outpatient setting, notes with presence of psychiatric terms were associated with reduction in likelihood of coronavirus testing for an individual patient, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 0.795 (95% CI 0.770-0.821) for anxiety to 0.631 (95% CI 0.563-0.705) for psychosis. Conversely, in the emergency department setting, presence of psychiatric terms was not associated with greater likelihood of testing. However, where violence was referenced, odds of testing were increased by nearly 50% (OR 1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761).\\nIn this electronic health records-based study of psychiatric symptoms during the first 3 months of 2020 across 5 Boston-area hospitals, we detect marked reduction in notes documenting psychiatric symptoms that corresponds to the emergence of COVID-19 diagnoses in the Boston area, and closely parallels the increase in COVID-19 testing. Such reductions are consistent across a range of symptoms, including psychosis, suggesting that they reflect a consistent diminution of psychiatric assessment.\\nWhile the magnitude of this change is notable, the presence of a shift is unsurprising, as outpatient visits are cancelled and individuals may be more reluctant to come to the emergency room out of concern for infection risk. Moreover, in settings where such symptoms might ordinarily be assessed, it is likely that clinicians dealing with limited resources and seeking to reduce exposure are more focused on addressing the primary diagnosis than would typically be the case. Outpatient notes do include telemedicine visits, .

In the outpatient setting, likelihood of such testing was significantly diminished when psychiatric symptoms were documented. This result may indicate a dichotomy between visits focused on suspected COVID-19, and psychiatric visits, with clinicians focusing treating such complaints as mutually exclusive. However, among emergency department notes, while symptoms were not associated with testing, reference to violence was associated with greater likelihood of testing. This latter finding may reflect a shift in psychopathology evaluation in the emergency department in the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Boston area, although further investigation and longer follow-up will be required to understand this shift. Importantly, these results cannot establish causation, and do not imply that individuals with psychiatric symptoms are more or less likely to be tested as a result of their symptoms per se.\\nWe note several additional limitations in interpreting our results. First, our detection of psychiatric symptoms uses simple string-matching in the interest of expediency and transferability to other health systems. While symptom tokens have previously been validated 13 , it is likely that more sophisticated natural language processing incorporating negation and bigrams would be more sensitive and specific. The advantage of the present approach is that is readily implemented in, for example, SQL query language. Second, while our results capture 5 Boston-area hospitals, other health systems will likely vary substantially in their response to onset and exacerbation of COVID-19. As such, rather than focusing on the magnitude of reduction, these results are likely better understood to .

Given abundant evidence from China that the COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on psychiatric symptoms among health care workers 45 and more broadly 6 , and emerging survey data from the UK and US 78 , one might expect to see an increase rather than decrease in such symptom presentations in Boston-area hospitals. Indeed, if visits were not markedly diminished, it seems likely such a change would be observed. However, the present results suggest that, if such an increase in symptoms exists, it is not driving more psychiatric visits. As such, efforts to provide more accessible psychiatric care during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic become particularly important: symptoms are likely to be increasing, while access is objectively decreasing. The accelerating shift to telemedicine may help to address this need 17 . However, given the apparent magnitude of the decrease, other strategies are also urgently needed to ensure that another consequence of the broadening pandemic is not neglect of new or worsening psychiatric symptoms.

       "7  Evidence from prior pandemics suggests that, along with the direct consequences of the infection itself, the public health impact can also be profound from a psychiatric perspective. As with any traumatic event, the acute stressor can be associated with increases in anxiety and depression, among other psychiatric symptoms 12 .\\nWhile the emergence of the worldwide coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been characterized in near-real-time, less is known about its impact on psychiatric care, particularly in the United States. Reviews suggest that beyond fear of the pandemic itself, containment strategies such as quarantine can also have profound effects 3 . Multiple surveys suggest significant prevalence of depression and anxiety among health care workers responding to COVID-19 in Wuhan, and China more broadly 45 . Web-based surveys 6 likewise find broad prevalence of such symptoms in less selected populations in China. In the United Kingdom, more than 60% of adults endorsed anxiety or worry 7 in a recent survey, and in the United States, ~1/3 of surveyed individuals reported COVID-19 had impacted their mental health 8 .\\nParticularly given constraints on ability to provide direct patient care imposed by quarantines and resource limitations, understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on provision of psychiatric care is critical. To date, many more individuals have been impacted by the fear of the pandemic and consequences of quarantine than by infection itself. Moreover, insofar as acute symptoms likely predict risk for longer-term sequelae such as posttraumatic stress syndrome, the ability to address such symptoms may have implications for efforts to anticipate and potentially reduce such sequelae 910 .\\n.

We examined both outpatient and emergency room settings, describing prevalence of these symptoms since January 2, 2020, as the pandemic emerged in the northeast United States. Specifically, we sought to understand how documentation of psychiatric symptoms changed as disease activity increased in Eastern Massachusetts, and whether presence of documented psychiatric symptoms was associated with greater or lesser probability of COVID-19 testing.\\nThe cohort included all individuals seen in outpatient visits or emergency rooms across 2 academic medical centers and 3 community affiliate hospitals between January 2, 2019 and March 25, 2020. Narrative clinical notes for all visits were extracted from the electronic health record serving all of these sites. Sociodemographic data including age, sex, race, and ethnicity were also drawn from the electronic health record. Presence of a coronavirus test was determined from the enterprise laboratory feed (LOINC:94309-2). All data were extracted from the Partners Research Patient Data Registry 11 and managed as an i2b2 datamart. 12 The Partners HealthCare Human Research Committee approved the study protocol.

These estimated RDoC domain scores have been validated against clinician review, and shown to predict longitudinal outcomes among psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations 14, 15 . For the present study, token lists were drawn from the appropriate domain(s) to reflect depression, anxiety, suicide, and psychosis. While not necessarily reflecting psychiatric symptoms, tokens capturing violence were also drawn from this set.\\nEach of the 2 cohorts, reflecting a single treatment setting, was analyzed individually.\\nPrimary descriptive analysis sought to capture volume of documentation by individual symptoms by day, based upon all notes, in comparison with volume of COVID-19 testing.\\nLogistic regression was used to examine the relationship between presence of coronavirus testing in the month of March (i.e., after testing was initiated) and individual psychiatric tokens, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

(Sensitivity analysis considering one randomly-selected note per individual, or index note, did not yield meaningfully different results and are not presented here, consistent with previous work using narrative notes in this health system; see, e.g., McCoy 14 .) All analyses utilized R 3.6.0 16 . provide insight regarding magnitude of subsequent decrease in visit frequency. Notes with mentions of anxiety dropped 75% for outpatient and 45% for ED from a weekly average in January and February, excluding holidays, to the week spanning 3/19/2020-3/25/2020 (decrease from 96,280 to 24,113 outpatient notes and 3,533 to 1,940, respectively). A similar decrease was observed for mentions of depression with a drop of 81% for outpatient and 44% for ED (decrease from 49,132 to 9,315 outpatient notes and 1,446 to 816, respectively). Similarly, Figure 1 (C) shows references to suicide, overdose, and violence, illustrating a similar pattern. For comparison, Figure 2 shows relative stability of age by week.\\n.

In the outpatient setting, notes with presence of psychiatric terms were associated with reduction in likelihood of coronavirus testing for an individual patient, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 0.795 (95% CI 0.770-0.821) for anxiety to 0.631 (95% CI 0.563-0.705) for psychosis. Conversely, in the emergency department setting, presence of psychiatric terms was not associated with greater likelihood of testing. However, where violence was referenced, odds of testing were increased by nearly 50% (OR 1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761).\\nIn this electronic health records-based study of psychiatric symptoms during the first 3 months of 2020 across 5 Boston-area hospitals, we detect marked reduction in notes documenting psychiatric symptoms that corresponds to the emergence of COVID-19 diagnoses in the Boston area, and closely parallels the increase in COVID-19 testing. Such reductions are consistent across a range of symptoms, including psychosis, suggesting that they reflect a consistent diminution of psychiatric assessment.\\nWhile the magnitude of this change is notable, the presence of a shift is unsurprising, as outpatient visits are cancelled and individuals may be more reluctant to come to the emergency room out of concern for infection risk. Moreover, in settings where such symptoms might ordinarily be assessed, it is likely that clinicians dealing with limited resources and seeking to reduce exposure are more focused on addressing the primary diagnosis than would typically be the case. Outpatient notes do include telemedicine visits, .

In the outpatient setting, likelihood of such testing was significantly diminished when psychiatric symptoms were documented. This result may indicate a dichotomy between visits focused on suspected COVID-19, and psychiatric visits, with clinicians focusing treating such complaints as mutually exclusive. However, among emergency department notes, while symptoms were not associated with testing, reference to violence was associated with greater likelihood of testing. This latter finding may reflect a shift in psychopathology evaluation in the emergency department in the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Boston area, although further investigation and longer follow-up will be required to understand this shift. Importantly, these results cannot establish causation, and do not imply that individuals with psychiatric symptoms are more or less likely to be tested as a result of their symptoms per se.\\nWe note several additional limitations in interpreting our results. First, our detection of psychiatric symptoms uses simple string-matching in the interest of expediency and transferability to other health systems. While symptom tokens have previously been validated 13 , it is likely that more sophisticated natural language processing incorporating negation and bigrams would be more sensitive and specific. The advantage of the present approach is that is readily implemented in, for example, SQL query language. Second, while our results capture 5 Boston-area hospitals, other health systems will likely vary substantially in their response to onset and exacerbation of COVID-19. As such, rather than focusing on the magnitude of reduction, these results are likely better understood to .

Given abundant evidence from China that the COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on psychiatric symptoms among health care workers 45 and more broadly 6 , and emerging survey data from the UK and US 78 , one might expect to see an increase rather than decrease in such symptom presentations in Boston-area hospitals. Indeed, if visits were not markedly diminished, it seems likely such a change would be observed. However, the present results suggest that, if such an increase in symptoms exists, it is not driving more psychiatric visits. As such, efforts to provide more accessible psychiatric care during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic become particularly important: symptoms are likely to be increasing, while access is objectively decreasing. The accelerating shift to telemedicine may help to address this need 17 . However, given the apparent magnitude of the decrease, other strategies are also urgently needed to ensure that another consequence of the broadening pandemic is not neglect of new or worsening psychiatric symptoms.

The speed of transmission caused by the high reproductive number of COVID-19 1 and the clinical needs associated with the clinical management of patients suffering from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) 2 has led to a gap between resources and needs which may prove decisive to the survival of many patients.\\nCOVID-19 entails a great need for clinical treatment, particularly extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMO) to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and which is pushing existing ICU facilities to breaking point as the pandemic expands 3 . As contagion worsens in each country, the best short-term strategy for containing the spread and so preventing health services from collapsing is social distancing, principally through a quarantine imposed by confining the population, as more and more governments are gradually doing, following WHO recommendations 4 . The objective of the WHO and of national authorities is to flatten the epidemic curve 5 so that health systems retain the capacity to clinically attend to patients in hospital centres and ICUs, while the scientific community strives to develop an effective vaccine or a viable antiviral.\\nIncreasing health resources rapidly is both complex and costly. The first country to be affected, China, promoted the building of macro-hospitals. Spain and Italy, the two countries currently most affected, have tried to drastically reduce time by using existing macro-buildings such as conference and trade fair centres. This strategy reduces the cost and, particularly, the time needed to set up ICU beds, making the volume of resources required depend mainly on the supply of medical equipment and on the availability of healthcare workers (Spain set up a field hospital with hundreds of beds at the IFEMA fair and conference facility in under 24 hours, and has since continued to expand it to an expected 5.000 beds (https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-03-21/llegan-los-primerospacientes-al-hospital-abierto-en-los-pabellones-de-ifema.html).\\nAnother issue that countries are having to face is how to deal with COVID-19 deaths. In countries where the mortality rate is higher, local funeral systems are unable to meet the cremation needs of COVID-19 deaths, posing saturation problems in the mortuaries. Italy has employed the army to distribute the corpses throughout the territory, moving them away from the most affected areas (http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/media/Coronavirustroppi-morti-a-Bergamo-esercito-porta-le-bare-in-altre-citta-9987ef6c-1056-47c4-862c-18e9255a541a.html#foto-1) while the authorities in Madrid have converted an ice rink into a makeshift mortuary (https://elpais.com/espana/madrid/2020-03-23/madridutilizara-como-morgue-las-instalaciones-del-palacio-de-hielo.html).\\nIn these circumstances, where time is key to determining how many lives might be saved, it is essential to have predictive models which can give health authorities a few days prior warning so as to expand their resources and adapt them to the needs they will soon be facing. Our work seeks to provide a predictive model that allows us to determine the needs of ICU beds as far in advance as possible, since admission to ICU offers around a 50% chance of survival for critically ill patients 9 . The model also helps to deal with the practical arrangements involved in dealing with so many deaths.\\nThrough its Ministry of Health website (https://www.mscbs.gob.es/), the Spanish government is providing daily data on the number of detected cases of infected people, deaths, and ICU admissions nationwide. Using officially published data, we econometrically estimate the following equations:\\nwhere i=1, 2 …,10 are the number of delays of the explanatory variable, ℎ ) is the total number of deaths up to day t,\\n) is the number of cases detected up to date t, ) is the number of ICU admissions up to date t, and t=1, 2 …,T representing each day. In equation (2), variables are defined as log ( ℎ ) + 1) and log ( )23 + 1) to avoid missing observations from the first few days where the number of deaths was zero. For equation (1), the sample period spans from 08/03/2020 to 24/03/2020, while in equation (2) the period spans from 28/02/2020 to 24/03/2020. We left March 25 and 26 as out-of-sample observations in order to measure the forecast performance of the estimated model. The estimation sample is shorter for equation (1) due to the lack of observations. Estimation is performed through the OLS estimator.\\nGiven that our main goal is to predict ICU beds and the number of deaths using the lagged number of infected cases, after estimating equations using different lags, we select the one with the best forecast performance (which minimises forecasting errors). Using data from 25/03/2020 and 26/03/2020 as out-of-sample period, we calculated RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE as indicators of predictive capacity. RMSE is defined as follows:\\nwhere N=2 is the number of out-of-sample observations, which we use to estimate the forecast performance of our estimate, C is the estimated value of the dependent variable, and is the actual value. Secondly, MSE is defined as follows:\\nMAPE is calculated using the following formula:\\nAll rights reserved.

Table 1 shows RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE values for the estimation of equation (1), using from 1 to 10 delays of the explanatory variable. We select the model including eight delays, since it shows the lowest value in the different indicators, which means it outperforms the other estimates in forecasting accuracy.\\nThe equation of the model that evidences the best forecast performance is the following:\\nThe coefficient = 0.7175 is what in economics is called elasticity; in this case delayed. We obtain it by deriving the function, and it represents the relationship between the variation of the dependent and independent variables:\\nThis delayed elasticity implies that a 1% increase in the number of infected cases predicts a 0.72% increase in the number of ICU patients eight days later. The estimate presents an R-square of 0.98.\\nOur model allows us to predict the number of ICU beds to be used, taking the number of people infected eight days earlier as a reference. In this way, we can anticipate the needs in terms of the number of beds for the next few days. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Table 2 shows the actual and estimated total number of ICU admissions for the period covered by the estimation, as well as the estimation error of the model. In addition, we include out-of-sample observations, which allows us to analyse the forecast performance of the model. To obtain the actual total number of ICU admissions, we perform the following transformation:\\nThat is, we convert the values in logs to total numbers. As the results show, the estimation error, measured as a percentage of total ICU admissions, decreases over the period, although in absolute terms it is greater. Figure 2 graphically shows these same results, including the ICU number estimated until 31/03/2020. As can be seen, the model allows us to very accurately predict the number of ICU patients. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is We proceed in the same way in the case of deaths caused by COVID-19. Table 3 shows the different forecast performance indicators calculated for the different models in equation (2) using up to 10 delays. According to the estimates, we select the model that includes the explanatory variable with five delays, since it produces the lowest values for the four different measures of forecast performance (RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE). We select the five-day delayed model, since it shows the best forecast performance according to the indicators.\\nThe equation of the model that presents the best forecast performance is: log( ℎ ) + 1) V = −2.7157 + 1.0896 * log ( )2c + 1) + ) the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is The delayed elasticity function is as follows:\\nshowing that a 1% increase in the number of infected cases detected predicts a 1.09% increase in the number of deaths six days later. The estimate presents a high goodness of fit, with an R-square of 0.97. Figure 3 displays the estimate of the model with respect to the actual values, both in logs.\\nAs was the case with ICU numbers, we find that residuals decrease throughout the estimation period, so that the estimate values at the end of the sample are closer to the actual values. Table 4 shows the number of actual and estimated deaths, as well as the errors for each time period. To obtain the total number of deaths, we carry out the following transformation:\\nResults show that the prediction error, in percentage terms, decreases over time. As for total values, it increases at the beginning of the period and then subsequently decreases.\\nAs regards the predicted out-of-sample values, we observe that the error is very small, the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is In Figure 4 , we see the trend in the actual number of deaths and their estimates in graphical terms. We also include the prediction of deaths obtained by the model up to 31/03/2020. The estimates show a high goodness of fit, presenting an R-square of 0.97, in addition to generating a prediction with a very low error, as shown in Table 3 . the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is \\nTo date, predictive models for COVID-19 have focused on predicting changes from exponential adjustments for the growth in the infected population, without a predefined contagion model 6, 7 or with a predefined contagion model 8 . These types of adjustments are highly dependent on the estimated equation, and lose their predictive accuracy when the growth rate of infections decreases. They also fail to determine the most statistically efficient maximum prediction time 6 . This makes them ineffective for prediction and prevents health authorities from obtaining reliable forecasts.\\nOur strategy consists of performing simple delayed regressions of the number of patients affected in ICUs, and deaths and by selecting the equation corresponding to the delay that provides the most statistically efficient prediction. By foregoing any epidemiological, or indeed any other type of objective, and by avoiding predetermining the function which is to be estimated, we are able to focus solely and exclusively on finding the best predictor.\\nThe result of this simple strategy is a model with a very high predictive accuracy, offering an eight-day advance for ICU admissions and a five-day advance for deaths. This advanced forecast is what can allow authorities to improve resource planning to face the clinical needs-health resources gap caused by the epidemic.\\nClearly, the findings are valid for Spain but not for other countries. However, the method is replicable to any country, state, or region. In addition, it is applicable to any type of health needs, provided we have data on their consumption. It can be applied to anticipate the needs of health staff, hospital beds, medicine, equipment ..., and can also be applied to anticipate other clinical situations apart from deaths. The method does, nevertheless, evidence certain shortcomings that must be taken into account and that basically affect the available data. The method only uses one independent variable, namely those officially declared as being infected, and which thus relies on the possibility of actually applying detection tests. It also depends on health authorities being truthful in their information policy. In Spain, few detection tests were carried out in the early stages of the outbreak, such that patients displaying mild symptoms were not tested. Large-scale testing of mild cases began around 20/03/2020 (https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/pontevedra/2020/03/20/test-rapidos-salir-cocheinician-hoy-cita-previa/0003_202003P20C1992.htm), although not throughout the whole country. Obviously, if the number of tests for possible COVID-19 infected cases were to be increased, the model would tend to overestimate ICUs and deaths and would need to be recalibrated. In other words, any significant change in the number of tests would affect our independent variable, the number of those declared as being infected, and would have consequences for the predictive performance of both independent variables.\\nMoreover, a second issue arises in one of the dependent variables. The number of patients in the UCIs represents the actual number of patients there, but not the number of patients who are in need of intensive care. If ICUs are swamped, medical staff will be forced to ethically screen critical patients 10 , such that data will cease to be representative of clinical needs and will become representative of the limited resources available. If we consider that this need to screen will increase the more the pandemic spreads and the greater the number of patients in need of ICU care, the model may be underestimating ICU needs as infection expands. Moreover, any improvement in clinical pharmacological treatment using antivirals in the pre-ICU admission stage will entail an overestimation of needs.\\nA third problem concerns the communication of data. Given the high reproductive number of COVID-19, contagion is growing exponentially, and having accurate daily data available is essential. When 800 patients die every day, at a rate of 33 deaths per hour, reporting the number of deaths inaccurately can lead to fundamental errors in the estimates. The health authorities must establish a specific time to report the numbers and must keep this stable, added to which health centres must prepare the counts accurately and ensure that they reflect the established time periods. In Spain, it was decided to close the daily count at 9.00 pm, and this is a time which must remain fixed until the pandemic is over. Obviously, public information must be truthful and any cases of UCIs being overwhelmed must be reported.\\nThe effect of data issues can be corrected in two ways: by increasing the variables whose numbers are gathered and published (for example, by publishing daily figures of the tests carried out and of their results or through the numbers of patients not admitted to UCIs as a result of previous ethical screening), and by recalibrating estimates if they lose their predictive accuracy. The first alternative would enable us to replace the variables or to correct them prior to performing estimations. The second alternative would allow us to refine the predictions recursively when the model loses its predictability. Whatever the case, this latter alternative can be performed daily given the ease of the method and the small amount of additional information required.\\nAll rights reserved.

In the first case, we obtain a 98% coefficient of determination, and in the second a 97% coefficient.

Our objective is rather to estimate a leading indicator of clinical needs. Having a forecast model available several days in advance can enable governments to more effectively face the gap between needs and resources triggered by the outbreak and thus reduce the deaths caused by COVID-19.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': 'No funding', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': 'Evidence before this study Daily news regarding the exponential growth of those affected by COVID-19 shows that healthcare resources are being overwhelmed by clinical needs in many countries. In particular, serious problems are arising in the most affected countries due to the shortage of ICU beds and the large number of deaths that the authorities are unable to deal with. National health authorities do not have adequate prediction mechanisms to facilitate clinical crisis management. We have performed bibliographic searches of the usual terms used to designate COVID-19, together with those of \"prediction\", \"estimation\", \"ICU\", \"mortality\" and the like, both in Pubmed and in Google Scholar. The predictive literature related to COVID-19 remains very sparse and the few models that do exist are based on exponential adjustments for forecasting the population affected. However, these models lose their predictive accuracy when the growth rate of infections decreases, added to which such models fail to determine the most statistically efficient maximum prediction time.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': 'We apply a previously unused method based on predictions through delayed logarithmic estimates of ICU admissions and deaths based on the number of infections.

       "45  The global health crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic has alerted governments worldwide. The speed of transmission caused by the high reproductive number of COVID-19 1 and the clinical needs associated with the clinical management of patients suffering from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) 2 has led to a gap between resources and needs which may prove decisive to the survival of many patients.\\nCOVID-19 entails a great need for clinical treatment, particularly extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMO) to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and which is pushing existing ICU facilities to breaking point as the pandemic expands 3 . As contagion worsens in each country, the best short-term strategy for containing the spread and so preventing health services from collapsing is social distancing, principally through a quarantine imposed by confining the population, as more and more governments are gradually doing, following WHO recommendations 4 . The objective of the WHO and of national authorities is to flatten the epidemic curve 5 so that health systems retain the capacity to clinically attend to patients in hospital centres and ICUs, while the scientific community strives to develop an effective vaccine or a viable antiviral.\\nIncreasing health resources rapidly is both complex and costly. The first country to be affected, China, promoted the building of macro-hospitals. Spain and Italy, the two countries currently most affected, have tried to drastically reduce time by using existing macro-buildings such as conference and trade fair centres. This strategy reduces the cost and, particularly, the time needed to set up ICU beds, making the volume of resources required depend mainly on the supply of medical equipment and on the availability of healthcare workers (Spain set up a field hospital with hundreds of beds at the IFEMA fair and conference facility in under 24 hours, and has since continued to expand it to an expected 5.000 beds (https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-03-21/llegan-los-primerospacientes-al-hospital-abierto-en-los-pabellones-de-ifema.html).\\nAnother issue that countries are having to face is how to deal with COVID-19 deaths. In countries where the mortality rate is higher, local funeral systems are unable to meet the cremation needs of COVID-19 deaths, posing saturation problems in the mortuaries. Italy has employed the army to distribute the corpses throughout the territory, moving them away from the most affected areas (http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/media/Coronavirustroppi-morti-a-Bergamo-esercito-porta-le-bare-in-altre-citta-9987ef6c-1056-47c4-862c-18e9255a541a.html#foto-1) while the authorities in Madrid have converted an ice rink into a makeshift mortuary (https://elpais.com/espana/madrid/2020-03-23/madridutilizara-como-morgue-las-instalaciones-del-palacio-de-hielo.html).\\nIn these circumstances, where time is key to determining how many lives might be saved, it is essential to have predictive models which can give health authorities a few days prior warning so as to expand their resources and adapt them to the needs they will soon be facing. Our work seeks to provide a predictive model that allows us to determine the needs of ICU beds as far in advance as possible, since admission to ICU offers around a 50% chance of survival for critically ill patients 9 . The model also helps to deal with the practical arrangements involved in dealing with so many deaths.\\nThrough its Ministry of Health website (https://www.mscbs.gob.es/), the Spanish government is providing daily data on the number of detected cases of infected people, deaths, and ICU admissions nationwide. Using officially published data, we econometrically estimate the following equations:\\nwhere i=1, 2 …,10 are the number of delays of the explanatory variable, ℎ ) is the total number of deaths up to day t,\\n) is the number of cases detected up to date t, ) is the number of ICU admissions up to date t, and t=1, 2 …,T representing each day. In equation (2), variables are defined as log ( ℎ ) + 1) and log ( )23 + 1) to avoid missing observations from the first few days where the number of deaths was zero. For equation (1), the sample period spans from 08/03/2020 to 24/03/2020, while in equation (2) the period spans from 28/02/2020 to 24/03/2020. We left March 25 and 26 as out-of-sample observations in order to measure the forecast performance of the estimated model. The estimation sample is shorter for equation (1) due to the lack of observations. Estimation is performed through the OLS estimator.\\nGiven that our main goal is to predict ICU beds and the number of deaths using the lagged number of infected cases, after estimating equations using different lags, we select the one with the best forecast performance (which minimises forecasting errors). Using data from 25/03/2020 and 26/03/2020 as out-of-sample period, we calculated RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE as indicators of predictive capacity. RMSE is defined as follows:\\nwhere N=2 is the number of out-of-sample observations, which we use to estimate the forecast performance of our estimate, C is the estimated value of the dependent variable, and is the actual value. Secondly, MSE is defined as follows:\\nMAPE is calculated using the following formula:\\nAll rights reserved.

Table 1 shows RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE values for the estimation of equation (1), using from 1 to 10 delays of the explanatory variable. We select the model including eight delays, since it shows the lowest value in the different indicators, which means it outperforms the other estimates in forecasting accuracy.\\nThe equation of the model that evidences the best forecast performance is the following:\\nThe coefficient = 0.7175 is what in economics is called elasticity; in this case delayed. We obtain it by deriving the function, and it represents the relationship between the variation of the dependent and independent variables:\\nThis delayed elasticity implies that a 1% increase in the number of infected cases predicts a 0.72% increase in the number of ICU patients eight days later. The estimate presents an R-square of 0.98.\\nOur model allows us to predict the number of ICU beds to be used, taking the number of people infected eight days earlier as a reference. In this way, we can anticipate the needs in terms of the number of beds for the next few days. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Table 2 shows the actual and estimated total number of ICU admissions for the period covered by the estimation, as well as the estimation error of the model. In addition, we include out-of-sample observations, which allows us to analyse the forecast performance of the model. To obtain the actual total number of ICU admissions, we perform the following transformation:\\nThat is, we convert the values in logs to total numbers. As the results show, the estimation error, measured as a percentage of total ICU admissions, decreases over the period, although in absolute terms it is greater. Figure 2 graphically shows these same results, including the ICU number estimated until 31/03/2020. As can be seen, the model allows us to very accurately predict the number of ICU patients. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is We proceed in the same way in the case of deaths caused by COVID-19. Table 3 shows the different forecast performance indicators calculated for the different models in equation (2) using up to 10 delays. According to the estimates, we select the model that includes the explanatory variable with five delays, since it produces the lowest values for the four different measures of forecast performance (RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE). We select the five-day delayed model, since it shows the best forecast performance according to the indicators.\\nThe equation of the model that presents the best forecast performance is: log( ℎ ) + 1) V = −2.7157 + 1.0896 * log ( )2c + 1) + ) the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is The delayed elasticity function is as follows:\\nshowing that a 1% increase in the number of infected cases detected predicts a 1.09% increase in the number of deaths six days later. The estimate presents a high goodness of fit, with an R-square of 0.97. Figure 3 displays the estimate of the model with respect to the actual values, both in logs.\\nAs was the case with ICU numbers, we find that residuals decrease throughout the estimation period, so that the estimate values at the end of the sample are closer to the actual values. Table 4 shows the number of actual and estimated deaths, as well as the errors for each time period. To obtain the total number of deaths, we carry out the following transformation:\\nResults show that the prediction error, in percentage terms, decreases over time. As for total values, it increases at the beginning of the period and then subsequently decreases.\\nAs regards the predicted out-of-sample values, we observe that the error is very small, the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is In Figure 4 , we see the trend in the actual number of deaths and their estimates in graphical terms. We also include the prediction of deaths obtained by the model up to 31/03/2020. The estimates show a high goodness of fit, presenting an R-square of 0.97, in addition to generating a prediction with a very low error, as shown in Table 3 . the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is \\nTo date, predictive models for COVID-19 have focused on predicting changes from exponential adjustments for the growth in the infected population, without a predefined contagion model 6, 7 or with a predefined contagion model 8 . These types of adjustments are highly dependent on the estimated equation, and lose their predictive accuracy when the growth rate of infections decreases. They also fail to determine the most statistically efficient maximum prediction time 6 . This makes them ineffective for prediction and prevents health authorities from obtaining reliable forecasts.\\nOur strategy consists of performing simple delayed regressions of the number of patients affected in ICUs, and deaths and by selecting the equation corresponding to the delay that provides the most statistically efficient prediction. By foregoing any epidemiological, or indeed any other type of objective, and by avoiding predetermining the function which is to be estimated, we are able to focus solely and exclusively on finding the best predictor.\\nThe result of this simple strategy is a model with a very high predictive accuracy, offering an eight-day advance for ICU admissions and a five-day advance for deaths. This advanced forecast is what can allow authorities to improve resource planning to face the clinical needs-health resources gap caused by the epidemic.\\nClearly, the findings are valid for Spain but not for other countries. However, the method is replicable to any country, state, or region. In addition, it is applicable to any type of health needs, provided we have data on their consumption. It can be applied to anticipate the needs of health staff, hospital beds, medicine, equipment ..., and can also be applied to anticipate other clinical situations apart from deaths. The method does, nevertheless, evidence certain shortcomings that must be taken into account and that basically affect the available data. The method only uses one independent variable, namely those officially declared as being infected, and which thus relies on the possibility of actually applying detection tests. It also depends on health authorities being truthful in their information policy. In Spain, few detection tests were carried out in the early stages of the outbreak, such that patients displaying mild symptoms were not tested. Large-scale testing of mild cases began around 20/03/2020 (https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/pontevedra/2020/03/20/test-rapidos-salir-cocheinician-hoy-cita-previa/0003_202003P20C1992.htm), although not throughout the whole country. Obviously, if the number of tests for possible COVID-19 infected cases were to be increased, the model would tend to overestimate ICUs and deaths and would need to be recalibrated. In other words, any significant change in the number of tests would affect our independent variable, the number of those declared as being infected, and would have consequences for the predictive performance of both independent variables.\\nMoreover, a second issue arises in one of the dependent variables. The number of patients in the UCIs represents the actual number of patients there, but not the number of patients who are in need of intensive care. If ICUs are swamped, medical staff will be forced to ethically screen critical patients 10 , such that data will cease to be representative of clinical needs and will become representative of the limited resources available. If we consider that this need to screen will increase the more the pandemic spreads and the greater the number of patients in need of ICU care, the model may be underestimating ICU needs as infection expands. Moreover, any improvement in clinical pharmacological treatment using antivirals in the pre-ICU admission stage will entail an overestimation of needs.\\nA third problem concerns the communication of data. Given the high reproductive number of COVID-19, contagion is growing exponentially, and having accurate daily data available is essential. When 800 patients die every day, at a rate of 33 deaths per hour, reporting the number of deaths inaccurately can lead to fundamental errors in the estimates. The health authorities must establish a specific time to report the numbers and must keep this stable, added to which health centres must prepare the counts accurately and ensure that they reflect the established time periods. In Spain, it was decided to close the daily count at 9.00 pm, and this is a time which must remain fixed until the pandemic is over. Obviously, public information must be truthful and any cases of UCIs being overwhelmed must be reported.\\nThe effect of data issues can be corrected in two ways: by increasing the variables whose numbers are gathered and published (for example, by publishing daily figures of the tests carried out and of their results or through the numbers of patients not admitted to UCIs as a result of previous ethical screening), and by recalibrating estimates if they lose their predictive accuracy. The first alternative would enable us to replace the variables or to correct them prior to performing estimations. The second alternative would allow us to refine the predictions recursively when the model loses its predictability. Whatever the case, this latter alternative can be performed daily given the ease of the method and the small amount of additional information required.\\nAll rights reserved.

       "      <td>After the incidence of some mysterious SARS-like cluster pneumonia, cases with unknown aetiology on December Wuhan, the center of coronavirus easing of its' 'City Closure' situation after a lap of two months since 23 January, 2020 for successful attempts of the Chinese Government (7,8), when the other countries have newly been imposed the lockdown for uncertain period of time. The recent claim of China that the new COVID-19 cases essentially to zero has become possible for their quick action of test widely to isolate infected ones, stunted peoples' unpopular movement except to get food and medical care, prohibit the leaving of own cities even homes of people and more importantly accepting the deep economy damage shut downed whole processing industry. The peak and quick recovery of the China made relax the rest of the world particularly the European countries. Moreover, Government of European countries' emphasize attitude towards public opinion for being of affluent democracies and peoples' free movement, easy travel and independent decision-making, which is now paying a price by counting 100,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 5,000 deaths with high fatality rate each dayexpecting that the worst is yet to come (9).\\nBy defying the geographical and political boundaries of western and temperate countries (like Italy, Spain, UK, USA etc.) the novel coronavirus has invaded towards tropical countries, excluding only a fewer than two dozen countries on the earth where there are no COVID-19 cases reported, so far. However, growth rate of conformed cases and fatalities are apparently slower in Asian tropical countries (like Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand etc.) than that of European temperate countries (10). This gap might be due to tropical countries with moderate economy are tended to be resource poor, not capable to do regular testing or there might be an impact of tropical weather to reduce the pandemic nature COVID-19, rather be a panic. A number of studies (11,12) argued that higher temperature and high relative humidity reduce the spreading capacity of new coronavirus to a greater extent, while there it would be popped again in 2020-2021 winter season (13). Researchers along with epidemiological experts also predicting COVID-19 cannot take advantage and bridgehead in the tropics than in the world's temperate regions (14) . A spatial analysis conducted by a research team from University of Maryland revealed that the transmission of COVID-19 lies mostly the regions across the equator where temperature ranges between 05-11°C with the combination of low specific (3-6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4-7 g/m 3 ) (15).\\nDepending on this complex context of COVID-19, this study is outlined to unpack the answers of the following research questions and formulate some recommendations to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\\n.

Published manuscripts, reports from different competent authorities, database and other documents on key areas of COVID-19 in different parts of the world were identified through searches in online journal sources and other available electronic sources.\\nThe proposed SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model developed by Choi and Pak (16) during the outbreak of SARS on 2003, was adopted in this study to make a prediction about the suspected cases and death from being the onset of COVID-19. The COVID-19 transmission pattern from person-to-person, no pint source nature and negligible amount of immunity development by the exposure patient during the inaugural stage of COVID-19 pandemic is more likely to SARS epidemic. Therefore, the same model was adopted using the same four available parameters basic reproduction number (R0), case fatality rate (F), incubation period (i) and duration of disease (d) regarding COVID-19 revealed by other researchers.\\n.

Any disease become epidemic in any population of a geographical area by increasing the secondary cases from a single (typical) infection in that complete susceptible population is termed as basic reproduction number (17). And the incubation period is the time laps between initial infection and disease onset (18). The R0 will be changed by the increasing of i. Following the first incubation period, the total number of cases will be 1+ R0 for being the producing of R0 new cases from the single infectious case at the very beginning of the disease forming its' epidemic nature. This will follow the quadrilateral nature in the subsequent periods of incubation and the total cases will be as 1 + (1 + R0) + (1 + R0 + R0 2 ) + …………. + (1 + R0 + R0 2 + ……… + R0 i ).\\nIf we consider C as the total number of predicted cases, then on t·i days the predicted number of incidents will be Ct·i. Predicted total cases (C) of COVID-19 was calculated following the modified equation of Choi and Pak, (2003). ∁ = 1 + (1 + 0 ) + (1 + 0 + 0 2 ) + … … … + (1 + 0 + 0 2 + … … … + 0 i ) = ∑ ∁ t·i ---------------------(i) Equation (i) was tested by taking imaginary value of R0 =5 and i = 5 days that predict that on day 15 there will be 125 new cases with the resulting of total 156 cases (Table 1) .\\nLike the case prediction of any epidemic disease, death prediction can also be done by a model using some parameters like basic reproductive number (R0), incubation period (i), duration of disease (d) and case fatality rate (F). Among these the first two is same of the case prediction model. Duration of disease (d) is the average time to diagnose people either cured or die.

Therefore, the predicted total number of deaths is\\nA trial was done for equation (ii) with the same value taken for equation (i) and taking the value for F = 20% and d = 14 days. The attempt reveals the prediction that first 0.2 persons will die from day 0 cases on day 14. Cases from day 5 will give 1 new death prediction with a total 1.2 persons' death on day 19 (Table 2 ).

The disease duration for COVID-19 has been set 14 days by WHO (28) used in this study. This means the case from day 0 will be recovered or dead on day 14. Similarly, from second incubation period i.e. patient from day 5 recovered or dead on day 19 and so on. Case fatality rate (F) values of COVID-19 is differed in different studies (29) (30) (31) , however to avoid the regional confinement, here in this study WHO reported COVID-19 case fatality rate (F) 3.4% (3) was used. This pointed that the death from the cases day 0 is 0.034 (1×3.4%) on day 14, as opposed to be recovered 0.966 people. The values of R0 and i selected in the was well adjusted with d and F values selected from WHOs' report.\\nIn case of determining the prediction for sub-tropical and tropical countries the incubation period (i) and duration of disease (d) values kept same, as these values do not vary by geographical variation for any kind of infectious disease (32) . For basic reproduction number (R0) and fatality rate (F) the values revealed by different regional researchers were collected, checked with the i and d value for adjustment and finalized (Table 3) .\\nIt was required two different types of data. Since for the prediction of daily new cases and deaths from COVID-19 the data from the official website of WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, USA (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) were used.

After the exact one-month laps of the first incidence of COVID-19 the deadly virus in Wuhan, China; the first reported case in for both Italy and Spain was on January 31, 2020. The result is presented of 90 days, while there is arrayed comparative results of predicted and observed for two months and another one month only predicted results. Predicted cases of both Italy and Spain was same as we used the same basic reproduction value for being of the countries from the same temperate and geographical position. However, the predicted total death varies across the countries as the fatality rate was not same (Table 5 and CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint (Table 8 ).\\nThe number of predicted cases and death was very much resembled after a certain time interval with that of the actual number of cases and death for both global and regional population, however it has some unexpected difference. Actual forecasting like \"How many people will be affected onset by the following days\" or \"The outbreak going to be peak or not in the coming month?\" of an epidemic disease from a transmission dynamics based model is quite tough (33). This is because the transmission dynamics based model is developed foothold on the official clinical surveillance data, which comes through a bureaucratic reporting chain of public health officials and government employees (34) who have to maintain privacy concern owing to geographical resolutions. Moreover, human (host) social behavior (35), potential changes in the pathogen (36) and host-pathogen interaction (37) dominates the epidemic models to a greater extent, while these are continuously change within an epidemic period. In case of COVID-19 the prediction from this study can be rippled for being down warding the basic reproduction value, which is already slowed from 2.9 to 2.4 (26) and also of the fatality rate which must be slow downed on the coming days for taking effective measure by the affected countries.\\nUsing the existing value of different parameters and incorporated the values in the epidemic model we revealed an estimation of global total cases (2286404188) and death numbers .

The prediction of these researchers will be close to half of our prediction including China if it continues to April 29, 2020, the end date until which we continued our prediction.\\nThe COVID-19 transmission shows a different trend of spread between the European temperate and Asian tropical countries. Though the first incident time has a gap of about one month, however the scenario between the countries of these two climatic regions has a head and tail difference. European countries is suffocating from the current COVID-19, a uncontrollable situation given applying modern medical facilities for their citizens by ensuring 11.5 critical care beds per 100,000 head of population (42) comparing with the only 3.6 critical care beds per 100,000 population in the entire Asian countries. The problem for European countries specifically in Italy and Spain is that they are getting 8.5 and 8.9 confirmed COVID-19 cases against per critical care bed (43), which is bounding them to take impossible choice of setting age limit for access to critical care bed. Though the European countries followed the same lockdown, test-trace-isolate infected ones', social distance strategy to defeat COVID-19 like .

Experts now also raised question about the effectuated tests quantity as well as quality variation between the two parts of the world when facing the same problem.\\nMoreover, there is criticism from the expert community for the individualistic hedonists of the Europeans, that dared the Government authorities to impose social distance or self-quarantine, which was quite easy in Asian countries for community-driven, and hierarchical nature of political and administrative intuitions. Not like war, the real war against pandemic COVID-19 the Europe's 27 centers of decision and 27 lines of command also lambaste by their own parliament member (44).\\nConcerning to climatic pattern, there is also vice-versa prediction from the scientist and epidemiologist communities. Expert opinion is that the Asian countries is taking advantage from onset spring and will be favored on door knocking summer from COVID-19 cold shock for their geographical position and climatic condition. Lowen and Stell (45) argued that the dropletmediated viral disease (SARS and MARS) survived in low absolute humidity (cold and dry weather) and attenuated the viral transmission in high absolute humidity (warm and humid weather), which can also be true for their genetic cousin COVID-19. However, Luo et al., (46) burst a vigilant caution that, the increasing temperature and humidity on the onset summer cannot hold back the COVID-19 transmission race too early. If anyhow the transmission is settled down in temperate countries taking the favor of high temperature and humidity, then Neher et al., (13) warned for having the chance of larger peak in the winter of 2020/21. Moreover, given the condition of very low spreads and fatality in the tropical countries, tend to be developing countries having very poor capacity of diagnosis and medical services, if the .

This will provide the information base for the individual countries to take the actions from the viewpoints of political action, social movement and health services.\\nBased on the analysis of secondary data in a predictive model, it was found that the that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high globally but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries for having lower temperature (7-16°C) and humidity (80-90%). However, some literature predicted that this might not be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in everywhere in the world particularly in the developing countries which have limited capacity of diagnosis and medical service, will be unknown unless the entire population is diagnosed.

       "18  [{'text': 'The spread of COVID-19 engulfs almost all the countries and territories of the planet, and infections and fatality are increasing rapidly. The first epi-center of its' massive spread was in Wuhan, Hubei province, China having a temperate weather, but the spread has got an unprecedented momentum in European temperate countries mainly in Italy and Spain (as of March 30, 2020). However, Malaysia and Singapore and the neighboring tropical countries of China got relatively low spread and fatality that created a research interest on whether there are potential impacts of weather condition on COVID-19 spread. Adopting the SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model to predict potential cases and death in the coming days from COVID-19 was done using the secondary and official sources of data. This study shows that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high across the world but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries having lower temperature (7-16°C) and humidity (80-90%) in last March. However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread and death. Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter. Therefore, a comprehensive global program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual states to take proper political action, social movement and medical services.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]   \n",

       "18  After the incidence of some mysterious SARS-like cluster pneumonia, cases with unknown aetiology on December Wuhan, the center of coronavirus easing of its' 'City Closure' situation after a lap of two months since 23 January, 2020 for successful attempts of the Chinese Government (7,8), when the other countries have newly been imposed the lockdown for uncertain period of time. The recent claim of China that the new COVID-19 cases essentially to zero has become possible for their quick action of test widely to isolate infected ones, stunted peoples' unpopular movement except to get food and medical care, prohibit the leaving of own cities even homes of people and more importantly accepting the deep economy damage shut downed whole processing industry. The peak and quick recovery of the China made relax the rest of the world particularly the European countries. Moreover, Government of European countries' emphasize attitude towards public opinion for being of affluent democracies and peoples' free movement, easy travel and independent decision-making, which is now paying a price by counting 100,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 5,000 deaths with high fatality rate each dayexpecting that the worst is yet to come (9).\\nBy defying the geographical and political boundaries of western and temperate countries (like Italy, Spain, UK, USA etc.) the novel coronavirus has invaded towards tropical countries, excluding only a fewer than two dozen countries on the earth where there are no COVID-19 cases reported, so far. However, growth rate of conformed cases and fatalities are apparently slower in Asian tropical countries (like Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand etc.) than that of European temperate countries (10). This gap might be due to tropical countries with moderate economy are tended to be resource poor, not capable to do regular testing or there might be an impact of tropical weather to reduce the pandemic nature COVID-19, rather be a panic. A number of studies (11,12) argued that higher temperature and high relative humidity reduce the spreading capacity of new coronavirus to a greater extent, while there it would be popped again in 2020-2021 winter season (13). Researchers along with epidemiological experts also predicting COVID-19 cannot take advantage and bridgehead in the tropics than in the world's temperate regions (14) . A spatial analysis conducted by a research team from University of Maryland revealed that the transmission of COVID-19 lies mostly the regions across the equator where temperature ranges between 05-11°C with the combination of low specific (3-6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4-7 g/m 3 ) (15).\\nDepending on this complex context of COVID-19, this study is outlined to unpack the answers of the following research questions and formulate some recommendations to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\\n.

Published manuscripts, reports from different competent authorities, database and other documents on key areas of COVID-19 in different parts of the world were identified through searches in online journal sources and other available electronic sources.\\nThe proposed SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model developed by Choi and Pak (16) during the outbreak of SARS on 2003, was adopted in this study to make a prediction about the suspected cases and death from being the onset of COVID-19. The COVID-19 transmission pattern from person-to-person, no pint source nature and negligible amount of immunity development by the exposure patient during the inaugural stage of COVID-19 pandemic is more likely to SARS epidemic. Therefore, the same model was adopted using the same four available parameters basic reproduction number (R0), case fatality rate (F), incubation period (i) and duration of disease (d) regarding COVID-19 revealed by other researchers.\\n.

Any disease become epidemic in any population of a geographical area by increasing the secondary cases from a single (typical) infection in that complete susceptible population is termed as basic reproduction number (17). And the incubation period is the time laps between initial infection and disease onset (18). The R0 will be changed by the increasing of i. Following the first incubation period, the total number of cases will be 1+ R0 for being the producing of R0 new cases from the single infectious case at the very beginning of the disease forming its' epidemic nature. This will follow the quadrilateral nature in the subsequent periods of incubation and the total cases will be as 1 + (1 + R0) + (1 + R0 + R0 2 ) + …………. + (1 + R0 + R0 2 + ……… + R0 i ).\\nIf we consider C as the total number of predicted cases, then on t·i days the predicted number of incidents will be Ct·i. Predicted total cases (C) of COVID-19 was calculated following the modified equation of Choi and Pak, (2003). ∁ = 1 + (1 + 0 ) + (1 + 0 + 0 2 ) + … … … + (1 + 0 + 0 2 + … … … + 0 i ) = ∑ ∁ t·i ---------------------(i) Equation (i) was tested by taking imaginary value of R0 =5 and i = 5 days that predict that on day 15 there will be 125 new cases with the resulting of total 156 cases (Table 1) .\\nLike the case prediction of any epidemic disease, death prediction can also be done by a model using some parameters like basic reproductive number (R0), incubation period (i), duration of disease (d) and case fatality rate (F). Among these the first two is same of the case prediction model. Duration of disease (d) is the average time to diagnose people either cured or die. In more simple words maximum days to onset symptoms of the disease and if not disease diagnosed .

Therefore, the predicted total number of deaths is\\nA trial was done for equation (ii) with the same value taken for equation (i) and taking the value for F = 20% and d = 14 days. The attempt reveals the prediction that first 0.2 persons will die from day 0 cases on day 14. Cases from day 5 will give 1 new death prediction with a total 1.2 persons' death on day 19 (Table 2 ).

The disease duration for COVID-19 has been set 14 days by WHO (28) used in this study. This means the case from day 0 will be recovered or dead on day 14. Similarly, from second incubation period i.e. patient from day 5 recovered or dead on day 19 and so on. Case fatality rate (F) values of COVID-19 is differed in different studies (29) (30) (31) , however to avoid the regional confinement, here in this study WHO reported COVID-19 case fatality rate (F) 3.4% (3) was used. This pointed that the death from the cases day 0 is 0.034 (1×3.4%) on day 14, as opposed to be recovered 0.966 people. The values of R0 and i selected in the was well adjusted with d and F values selected from WHOs' report.\\nIn case of determining the prediction for sub-tropical and tropical countries the incubation period (i) and duration of disease (d) values kept same, as these values do not vary by geographical variation for any kind of infectious disease (32) . For basic reproduction number (R0) and fatality rate (F) the values revealed by different regional researchers were collected, checked with the i and d value for adjustment and finalized (Table 3) .\\nIt was required two different types of data. Since for the prediction of daily new cases and deaths from COVID-19 the data from the official website of WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, USA (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) were used. The weather data of temperate and tropical countries were gathered from authentic website of Weather Atlas (https://www.weather-atlas.com). All the collected data was imputed, analyzed and generated results using Excel (Microsoft Corporation).\\n.

After the exact one-month laps of the first incidence of COVID-19 the deadly virus in Wuhan, China; the first reported case in for both Italy and Spain was on January 31, 2020. The result is presented of 90 days, while there is arrayed comparative results of predicted and observed for two months and another one month only predicted results. Predicted cases of both Italy and Spain was same as we used the same basic reproduction value for being of the countries from the same temperate and geographical position. However, the predicted total death varies across the countries as the fatality rate was not same (Table 5 and CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint (Table 8 ).\\nThe number of predicted cases and death was very much resembled after a certain time interval with that of the actual number of cases and death for both global and regional population, however it has some unexpected difference. Actual forecasting like \"How many people will be affected onset by the following days\" or \"The outbreak going to be peak or not in the coming month?\" of an epidemic disease from a transmission dynamics based model is quite tough (33). This is because the transmission dynamics based model is developed foothold on the official clinical surveillance data, which comes through a bureaucratic reporting chain of public health officials and government employees (34) who have to maintain privacy concern owing to geographical resolutions. Moreover, human (host) social behavior (35), potential changes in the pathogen (36) and host-pathogen interaction (37) dominates the epidemic models to a greater extent, while these are continuously change within an epidemic period. In case of COVID-19 the prediction from this study can be rippled for being down warding the basic reproduction value, which is already slowed from 2.9 to 2.4 (26) and also of the fatality rate which must be slow downed on the coming days for taking effective measure by the affected countries.\\nUsing the existing value of different parameters and incorporated the values in the epidemic model we revealed an estimation of global total cases (2286404188) and death numbers .

The prediction of these researchers will be close to half of our prediction including China if it continues to April 29, 2020, the end date until which we continued our prediction.\\nThe COVID-19 transmission shows a different trend of spread between the European temperate and Asian tropical countries. Though the first incident time has a gap of about one month, however the scenario between the countries of these two climatic regions has a head and tail difference. European countries is suffocating from the current COVID-19, a uncontrollable situation given applying modern medical facilities for their citizens by ensuring 11.5 critical care beds per 100,000 head of population (42) comparing with the only 3.6 critical care beds per 100,000 population in the entire Asian countries. The problem for European countries specifically in Italy and Spain is that they are getting 8.5 and 8.9 confirmed COVID-19 cases against per critical care bed (43), which is bounding them to take impossible choice of setting age limit for access to critical care bed. Though the European countries followed the same lockdown, test-trace-isolate infected ones', social distance strategy to defeat COVID-19 like .

Experts now also raised question about the effectuated tests quantity as well as quality variation between the two parts of the world when facing the same problem.\\nMoreover, there is criticism from the expert community for the individualistic hedonists of the Europeans, that dared the Government authorities to impose social distance or self-quarantine, which was quite easy in Asian countries for community-driven, and hierarchical nature of political and administrative intuitions. Not like war, the real war against pandemic COVID-19 the Europe's 27 centers of decision and 27 lines of command also lambaste by their own parliament member (44).\\nConcerning to climatic pattern, there is also vice-versa prediction from the scientist and epidemiologist communities. Expert opinion is that the Asian countries is taking advantage from onset spring and will be favored on door knocking summer from COVID-19 cold shock for their geographical position and climatic condition. Lowen and Stell (45) argued that the dropletmediated viral disease (SARS and MARS) survived in low absolute humidity (cold and dry weather) and attenuated the viral transmission in high absolute humidity (warm and humid weather), which can also be true for their genetic cousin COVID-19. However, Luo et al., (46) burst a vigilant caution that, the increasing temperature and humidity on the onset summer cannot hold back the COVID-19 transmission race too early.

However, some literature predicted that this might not be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in everywhere in the world particularly in the developing countries which have limited capacity of diagnosis and medical service, will be unknown unless the entire population is diagnosed. The asymptotic career might be the cause of outbreak in the coming winter while whether will be again favorable for COVID-19 incubation in both tropics of the world.

       "      <td>The number of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 , is dramatically increasing worldwide [1] . The first person-to-person transmission in Italy was reported on Feb 21st, 2020, and led to an infection chain that represents the largest COVID-19 outbreak outside Asia to date. At the moment, Italy is the second most affected country in the World and the first in Europe, with more than 62000 confirmed cases according to the Italian Department of Civil Protection as of 26th of March 2020. What it is not clearly identified so far is the reasons for the strong involvement of Italy within the European countries [2] and even more why the spread of this epidemic has not followed a uniform pattern on the territory: the diffusion of the disease, at the moment, is focused on the northern regions of the country. This was particularly evident considering that the virus took some days to reach the central and the southern regions of the land. Currently, the 87% of the confirmed actual cases are inhabitants of the northern regions that counts the 55% of the total Italian population. Among them, where the first cases were identified at the end February, is still the region with the majority of individuals infected by the COVID-19 virus. Similar results can be noted considering the hospitalization in general (88% in the northern regions and 42% in ) and in the intensive care unit in particular (85% in the northern regions and 35% in ). This data are provided and daily updated by the Italian Civil Protection Department [3] . These numbers are indicative of the spread of the infection and underline that one the main challenges to be faced by the National and the Regional Health Systems is the management of hospital resources across the country in terms of professionals, medical devices and hospital beds, with a particular attention on the intensive care unit (ICU) [4] .\\nGiven this high demand of hospitalization and critical care, Italian hospitals and in particular those located in the northern regions have been overloaded and the majority of them are struggling to cope with patients infected by the COVID-19 in addition to those who are hospitalized from other diseases. This has led the actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past years the number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Different newspapers have highlighted that a reduction in the number of beds have affected many hospitals over the territory. This resource reduction is mainly related to the progressive cutting of the national and local budget in the last .

This lack of beds is confirmed by a recent study of the OECD that reported that our country counts 2.6 hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants [6] , ranking Italy at the 19 th place over 23 countries with Germany having more than 6 beds per 1000 inhabitants. However, this data does not consider the number of ICUs. The most recent study reporting the number of beds specifically for the ICU was published by Rhodes et al in 2012 [7] . Also in this case the number of beds located in Italy are below the European average with 12.9 beds per 100000 inhabitants, while Germany is equipped with 29.2 beds. The analysis of the Italian National Healthcare Service should take into account that health services are organized and delivered under the responsibility of local authorities structured at a regional level, while the Italian Government has a weak strategic leadership.\\nStarting from these premises, the aim of this study is to analyse the Italian regional hospital systems in order to assess the efficiency and the performance of the hospital bed management in the years that precede the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific attention is given to the management of the intensive care unit departments. In this perspective, there are two methodologies adopted to assess the efficiency of a health structure in the management of clinical hospitalized cases: the first one is the hospital bed management [8] [9] [10] that provides an overall description of the use of beds by health structures. The second methodology evaluates the performance of a hospital considering the complexity of the cases treated by the structure [11] [12] . Both methodologies investigate hospital performances providing a helpful snapshot for healthcare managers for the evaluation of healthcare systems [13] .\\nThe paper is structured as follows: after the materials and methods paragraph, a picture of the virus diffusion and workload of the hospital infrastructure is reported to provide an overview of the extraordinary event faced by the health and social care professionals in Italy. After that, a comparison of data captured in the years 2010 and 2017 is performed to verify the differences across years in terms of hospital beds available in each region. Finally, the results of the hospital bed management analysis are reported to capture the efficiency as well as the complexity and performance of patient hospitalizations.\\n.

The first one provides daily data on the diffusion and hospital infrastructure consumption during the COVID-19 outbreak. They are collected by the Italian Civil Protection Department and collected on several web sites [3] . The second information flow concerns data on hospital bed management. Administrative and clinical data produced during the hospitalization process are collected in Discharge Report Forms and sent by the hospital information systems of a single health provider and centrally collected by the Ministry of Health. They describe each service provided to a patient as well as facilities available and staff employed in the relevant structure. This information is aggregated and published in the web site of the Ministry of Health [14] . The data analysed in this study refer to the year 2017, the latest data published by the Ministry of Health. Moreover, data captured for the year 2010 are analysed to examine differences between 2010 and 2017 in terms of resources available across the territory. This study considers both the public and private institutes, excluding the private nursing homes. The datasets gathered from the Ministry of Health website [14] and the relevant analyses performed during the current study are available in the Zenodo repository [15] .\\nThe overall description of the hospital bed management is assessed using the following indicators computed on the basis of the number of beds, the patient discharged over a specific period of time (i.e. a year) and total number of in-patient days (i.e. the overall number of days that all the patients are hospitalized) [16] .\\n• Beds Occupancy Rate (BOR): percentage of inpatient beds occupied over a specific period;\\n• Average Length Of Stay (AvLOS): average number of days that an inpatients remained in the hospital;\\n• Turnover Interval (TOI): number of days that an available bed remains empty between the discharge of a patient and the admission of a next one;\\n• Beds Turn Over (BTO): average number of patients \"passing through\" each bed during a specific period.\\n.

These values have been used to classify each region in the following areas: 1) the red one that identifies regions where both TOI and BOR are outside the reference threshold; 2) the yellow area that reports regions where either TOI or BOR are outside the threshold and 3) the green area that identifies regions where both indicators are within the reference thresholds.\\nThe complexity and the performance of each clinical department in the management of clinical hospitalization cases are described, respectively, by the Case Mix (CMI) and the Performance Index (PI). In particular, the former indicates the degree of complexity in each observed unit with respect to a benchmark level (i.e. the national average), while the PI compares the performance of the observed unit considering the inpatient length of stays compared to the benchmark level.\\nThese indicators are computed according to the following formulas, taking into account the different clinical specialties addressed by the relevant structure.\\nWhere the variables indicate:\\n• n: number of specialties assessed by the structure;\\n: Italian AvLOS of the specialty j;\\n: Italian AvLOS of all specialties;\\n: number of patient discharges in Italy of the specialty j\\n: total number of patient discharges in Italy;\\n: AvLOS of the specialty j in the relevant structure;\\n: number of patients discharged in the relevant structure for the specialty j;\\n: total number of patients discharges in the relevant structure.\\n.

Considering the graphical representation, these indicators are analysed adopting a four-quadrant graph where the CMI is reported in the abscissa and the PI is reported in the ordinate compared to the national benchmark.\\nSince the beginning of the infection through the identification of the first cases in the north of Italy, the number of patients infected closely follows an exponential trend, with a slightly change during the last week turning from an exponential to a linear trend. This tendency is appreciable not only considering the total number cases, but also the number of deaths, healed as well as the number of patients hospitalized in general and in the intensive care units dislocated all over the country. Trends describing the hospitalizations are reported in Figure 1 considering both the country as a whole and the region in particular, that still represents the region with the highest number of cases in Italy. These trends highlight the tremendous amount of work carried out by the healthcare professionals to host the exceptional number of patients to be hospitalized in the health structures. .

A highlighted in Table 1 , an important reduction of the hospital beds is evident all over the Italian regions. This reduction on the same time matches with a reduction of both number of patients hospitalized and number of days spent in the hospital. Differences across the country can be highlighted with the highest reductions in the southern regions. Considering the northern region heavily affected by the COVID-19, the reduction ranges from -5% in Bolzano and Val d'Aosta to -23% in Trento, while Lombardy cuts around the 7% of hospital beds. .

Table 2 highlights that the availability of the number of beds in this department did not change across years with an increasing number of beds around 6% all over the territory. Of course, also in this analysis differences across regions can be detected. However, only five regions have reduced the number of beds in this department with the highest cut found in Lazio, Liguria and Piemonte (5%). .

As reported in the Table only oncology and intensive care unit wards have had an increase in the number of beds in Italy, while in other clinical specializations the reduction was even more than 20%, among which surgery, paediatrics and otolaryngology. This indicates that, among the wards that manage complex hospital cases, the availability of hospital beds was not affected by the funding cuts to public health. However, these crude differences may take into account that, in the last years, many European countries have adopted policies to strongly shift the organization and provision of health and social services from formal institutional facilities (e.g. hospitals) to home care [17] . Moreover, recently the provision of different scheduled procedures (e.g. diagnostic test, clinical examinations, treatments) are mainly provided in a day hospital, reducing the number of beds needed to treat the patients. Other differences that can be detected analysing the availability of hospital beds refers to their distribution in the 21 regions and autonomous provinces. Figure 3 reports the number of beds per 100.000 inhabitants both considering all disciplines (A) and focusing on the intensive care unit departments (B). The proportions vary across the country spanning from Molise that counts the highest values for both categories to Calabria that displays the lowest proportions. In this overall picture, while, generally, the south of Italy suffers the lack of hospital beds, lays in the middle of the rank with 279 beds in total and 8 intensive care unit beds per 100000 inhabitants. 2. The second group of regions (Calabria, Campania, Bolzano e Puglia) has similar results compared to the above cluster, with hospitalizations efficiently managed with high performances. Differently from the above-mentioned group, these regions tend to manage cases that are less complex.\\n3. Six regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia, Piemonte, Valle D'Aosta, Veneto, Liguria e Lombardy) manage the hospital beds with a high turnover and beds that remain scarcely empty during the year.\\nHowever, this is mainly due to a high length of stay that result in a low level of performance with respect to the national level, even if these regions mainly manage complex cases.\\n4. The last group is composed by four regions (Lazio, Marche, Sicilia e Sardegna). Even if they have positive values in the hospital bed turnover and turnover interval, the performance is lower than the national reference value also considering that these regions tend to manage less complex cases.\\n.

Table 5 2) A consistent number of regions (Basilicata, Campania, Molise, Sicilia, Abruzzo, Puglia e Lazio) belong to the second cluster.

Also for this reason, even if these regions tend to cope with complex cases and pathologies, their performance is lower than the national one.\\n3) In three regions (Liguria, Toscana e Veneto) hospital beds are not efficiently managed with a low performance in the management of not so complex cases. This is mainly due to the low complexity of cases hospitalized with a length of stay higher than the national average value. In this classification Marche represents an outlier in the management of hospital beds. Differently from the last reported cluster it manages complex cases with a relative high performance. \\nCOVID-19 is one of the most serious respiratory pandemics of the past 100 years, its rapid global spread is overwhelming hospitals and local communities in Italy. One of the main challenges to be faced by the Italian hospitals is to provide hospital beds for patients affected by this virus with a particular attention of the intensive care unit department. This is particularly evident considering that, at the moment, the majority of the northern regions in Italy are suffering with a low number of available beds and that others presumably saturate their capacity in the following days.\\nThe lack of hospital beds has been attributed to a set of important cuts in the financing of public health over the last years that also result in a reduction of hospital beds both in general and in the intensive care units on the whole territory.\\n. CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055848 doi: medRxiv preprint This paper provides an overview of the efficiency in the management of hospital beds across Italian regions also highlighting whether a substantial reduction of hospital beds has been carried out recently. The results of the overall analysis firstly show that even if an important reduction of hospital beds affects the majority of the hospital wards, an opposite trend has been detected for the intensive care unit. This is particularly evident considering the regions that are most effected by the virus: Lombardy +11%, Marche +12%, Piemonte -5%, Trento +55%, Bolzano +3%, Veneto +4%.\\nHospital beds are generally efficiently managed all over the country with some exceptions in the south of Italy that show a slow turnover and/or a low bed occupancy rate. This positive result is particularly evident in the regions of northern Italy where cases are handled with rapid shifts, also without leaving beds empty during the year. Moreover, generally northern regions mainly deal with complex cases albeit with a performance below the national average. On the contrary, different results are displayed analysing the management of beds in the intensive care units, where the 75% occupancy rate threshold is not reached in all regions. In this sense, the northern regions exhibit a high performance, even if related to the management of less complex cases.\\nIn conclusion this study highlights that in the recent years there has been no substation reduction of the hospital beds located in the intensive care units. Differently other wards suffered of the financial cuts done by national and regional governments to the public health. However, this trend may also take into account two important factors. On the one hand, the provision of health services is now shifting from formal institutional facilities (e.g. hospitals) to home care and, on the other hand, different scheduled procedures are mainly provided in a day hospital reducing the number of beds needed to treat the patients. The majority of the Italian regions and in particular those in the northern part of the country can rely on an appropriate number of beds that generally do not saturate in periods when the patient flow is not conditioned by catastrophic events like what we have been going through these weeks. This availability of hospital beds as well as the efficiency in their management confirmed in this study allow hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds. In fact, the analysis reported in this paper showed that, in normal situations, the management of hospital and intensive care beds has no critical levels, while in pandemic or other catastrophic periods, the hospital management paradigms change [18] .

Considering that post-intensive care and intensive care continuously bed availability daily changes across the land and the European countries, it is not possible to apply this methodology in this pandemic period. However, an ex post analysis should be applied in the future to provide indications on the hospital-territory relationship in response to widespread social problems.\\n</td>\n",

       "43  [{'text': 'In the first months of 2020 an increasing number of individuals worldwide are infected by the coronavirus disease 2019 . A particularly severe diffusion of the virus has affected Italy and in particular its northern regions. This is resulting in a high demand of hospitalization with a particular attention on the intensive care units (ICUs). Hospitals are suffering the high degree of patients to be treated for respiratory diseases and the majority of the structures located in the north of Italy are or are going to be saturated. This has led the actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past years the number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Aim of this study is to analyse the availability of hospital beds across the country as well as to determine their management in terms of complexity and performance of cases treated at regional level. The results of this study underlines that, despite the reduction of beds for the majority of the hospital wards, ICUs availabilities did not change between 2010 and 2017. Moreover, this study confirms that the majority of the Italian regions efficiently manage these structural facilities allowing hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an .

       "43  The number of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 , is dramatically increasing worldwide [1] . The first person-to-person transmission in Italy was reported on Feb 21st, 2020, and led to an infection chain that represents the largest COVID-19 outbreak outside Asia to date. At the moment, Italy is the second most affected country in the World and the first in Europe, with more than 62000 confirmed cases according to the Italian Department of Civil Protection as of 26th of March 2020. What it is not clearly identified so far is the reasons for the strong involvement of Italy within the European countries [2] and even more why the spread of this epidemic has not followed a uniform pattern on the territory: the diffusion of the disease, at the moment, is focused on the northern regions of the country. This was particularly evident considering that the virus took some days to reach the central and the southern regions of the land. Currently, the 87% of the confirmed actual cases are inhabitants of the northern regions that counts the 55% of the total Italian population. Among them, where the first cases were identified at the end February, is still the region with the majority of individuals infected by the COVID-19 virus. Similar results can be noted considering the hospitalization in general (88% in the northern regions and 42% in ) and in the intensive care unit in particular (85% in the northern regions and 35% in ). This data are provided and daily updated by the Italian Civil Protection Department [3] . These numbers are indicative of the spread of the infection and underline that one the main challenges to be faced by the National and the Regional Health Systems is the management of hospital resources across the country in terms of professionals, medical devices and hospital beds, with a particular attention on the intensive care unit (ICU) [4] .\\nGiven this high demand of hospitalization and critical care, Italian hospitals and in particular those located in the northern regions have been overloaded and the majority of them are struggling to cope with patients infected by the COVID-19 in addition to those who are hospitalized from other diseases. This has led the actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past years the number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Different newspapers have highlighted that a reduction in the number of beds have affected many hospitals over the territory. This resource reduction is mainly related to the progressive cutting of the national and local budget in the last .

This lack of beds is confirmed by a recent study of the OECD that reported that our country counts 2.6 hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants [6] , ranking Italy at the 19 th place over 23 countries with Germany having more than 6 beds per 1000 inhabitants. However, this data does not consider the number of ICUs. The most recent study reporting the number of beds specifically for the ICU was published by Rhodes et al in 2012 [7] . Also in this case the number of beds located in Italy are below the European average with 12.9 beds per 100000 inhabitants, while Germany is equipped with 29.2 beds. The analysis of the Italian National Healthcare Service should take into account that health services are organized and delivered under the responsibility of local authorities structured at a regional level, while the Italian Government has a weak strategic leadership.\\nStarting from these premises, the aim of this study is to analyse the Italian regional hospital systems in order to assess the efficiency and the performance of the hospital bed management in the years that precede the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific attention is given to the management of the intensive care unit departments. In this perspective, there are two methodologies adopted to assess the efficiency of a health structure in the management of clinical hospitalized cases: the first one is the hospital bed management [8] [9] [10] that provides an overall description of the use of beds by health structures. The second methodology evaluates the performance of a hospital considering the complexity of the cases treated by the structure [11] [12] . Both methodologies investigate hospital performances providing a helpful snapshot for healthcare managers for the evaluation of healthcare systems [13] .\\nThe paper is structured as follows: after the materials and methods paragraph, a picture of the virus diffusion and workload of the hospital infrastructure is reported to provide an overview of the extraordinary event faced by the health and social care professionals in Italy. After that, a comparison of data captured in the years 2010 and 2017 is performed to verify the differences across years in terms of hospital beds available in each region. Finally, the results of the hospital bed management analysis are reported to capture the efficiency as well as the complexity and performance of patient hospitalizations.\\n.

The first one provides daily data on the diffusion and hospital infrastructure consumption during the COVID-19 outbreak. They are collected by the Italian Civil Protection Department and collected on several web sites [3] . The second information flow concerns data on hospital bed management. Administrative and clinical data produced during the hospitalization process are collected in Discharge Report Forms and sent by the hospital information systems of a single health provider and centrally collected by the Ministry of Health. They describe each service provided to a patient as well as facilities available and staff employed in the relevant structure. This information is aggregated and published in the web site of the Ministry of Health [14] . The data analysed in this study refer to the year 2017, the latest data published by the Ministry of Health. Moreover, data captured for the year 2010 are analysed to examine differences between 2010 and 2017 in terms of resources available across the territory. This study considers both the public and private institutes, excluding the private nursing homes. The datasets gathered from the Ministry of Health website [14] and the relevant analyses performed during the current study are available in the Zenodo repository [15] .\\nThe overall description of the hospital bed management is assessed using the following indicators computed on the basis of the number of beds, the patient discharged over a specific period of time (i.e. a year) and total number of in-patient days (i.e. the overall number of days that all the patients are hospitalized) [16] .\\n• Beds Occupancy Rate (BOR): percentage of inpatient beds occupied over a specific period;\\n• Average Length Of Stay (AvLOS): average number of days that an inpatients remained in the hospital;\\n• Turnover Interval (TOI): number of days that an available bed remains empty between the discharge of a patient and the admission of a next one;\\n• Beds Turn Over (BTO): average number of patients \"passing through\" each bed during a specific period.\\n.

These values have been used to classify each region in the following areas: 1) the red one that identifies regions where both TOI and BOR are outside the reference threshold; 2) the yellow area that reports regions where either TOI or BOR are outside the threshold and 3) the green area that identifies regions where both indicators are within the reference thresholds.\\nThe complexity and the performance of each clinical department in the management of clinical hospitalization cases are described, respectively, by the Case Mix (CMI) and the Performance Index (PI). In particular, the former indicates the degree of complexity in each observed unit with respect to a benchmark level (i.e. the national average), while the PI compares the performance of the observed unit considering the inpatient length of stays compared to the benchmark level.\\nThese indicators are computed according to the following formulas, taking into account the different clinical specialties addressed by the relevant structure.\\nWhere the variables indicate:\\n• n: number of specialties assessed by the structure;\\n: Italian AvLOS of the specialty j;\\n: Italian AvLOS of all specialties;\\n: number of patient discharges in Italy of the specialty j\\n: total number of patient discharges in Italy;\\n: AvLOS of the specialty j in the relevant structure;\\n: number of patients discharged in the relevant structure for the specialty j;\\n: total number of patients discharges in the relevant structure.\\n.

Considering the graphical representation, these indicators are analysed adopting a four-quadrant graph where the CMI is reported in the abscissa and the PI is reported in the ordinate compared to the national benchmark.\\nSince the beginning of the infection through the identification of the first cases in the north of Italy, the number of patients infected closely follows an exponential trend, with a slightly change during the last week turning from an exponential to a linear trend. This tendency is appreciable not only considering the total number cases, but also the number of deaths, healed as well as the number of patients hospitalized in general and in the intensive care units dislocated all over the country. Trends describing the hospitalizations are reported in Figure 1 considering both the country as a whole and the region in particular, that still represents the region with the highest number of cases in Italy. These trends highlight the tremendous amount of work carried out by the healthcare professionals to host the exceptional number of patients to be hospitalized in the health structures. .

A highlighted in Table 1 , an important reduction of the hospital beds is evident all over the Italian regions. This reduction on the same time matches with a reduction of both number of patients hospitalized and number of days spent in the hospital. Differences across the country can be highlighted with the highest reductions in the southern regions. Considering the northern region heavily affected by the COVID-19, the reduction ranges from -5% in Bolzano and Val d'Aosta to -23% in Trento, while Lombardy cuts around the 7% of hospital beds. .

Table 2 highlights that the availability of the number of beds in this department did not change across years with an increasing number of beds around 6% all over the territory. Of course, also in this analysis differences across regions can be detected. However, only five regions have reduced the number of beds in this department with the highest cut found in Lazio, Liguria and Piemonte (5%). .

As reported in the Table only oncology and intensive care unit wards have had an increase in the number of beds in Italy, while in other clinical specializations the reduction was even more than 20%, among which surgery, paediatrics and otolaryngology. This indicates that, among the wards that manage complex hospital cases, the availability of hospital beds was not affected by the funding cuts to public health. However, these crude differences may take into account that, in the last years, many European countries have adopted policies to strongly shift the organization and provision of health and social services from formal institutional facilities (e.g. hospitals) to home care [17] . Moreover, recently the provision of different scheduled procedures (e.g. diagnostic test, clinical examinations, treatments) are mainly provided in a day hospital, reducing the number of beds needed to treat the patients. Other differences that can be detected analysing the availability of hospital beds refers to their distribution in the 21 regions and autonomous provinces. Figure 3 reports the number of beds per 100.000 inhabitants both considering all disciplines (A) and focusing on the intensive care unit departments (B). The proportions vary across the country spanning from Molise that counts the highest values for both categories to Calabria that displays the lowest proportions. In this overall picture, while, generally, the south of Italy suffers the lack of hospital beds, lays in the middle of the rank with 279 beds in total and 8 intensive care unit beds per 100000 inhabitants. 2. The second group of regions (Calabria, Campania, Bolzano e Puglia) has similar results compared to the above cluster, with hospitalizations efficiently managed with high performances. Differently from the above-mentioned group, these regions tend to manage cases that are less complex.\\n3. Six regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia, Piemonte, Valle D'Aosta, Veneto, Liguria e Lombardy) manage the hospital beds with a high turnover and beds that remain scarcely empty during the year.\\nHowever, this is mainly due to a high length of stay that result in a low level of performance with respect to the national level, even if these regions mainly manage complex cases.\\n4. The last group is composed by four regions (Lazio, Marche, Sicilia e Sardegna). Even if they have positive values in the hospital bed turnover and turnover interval, the performance is lower than the national reference value also considering that these regions tend to manage less complex cases.\\n.

Table 5 2) A consistent number of regions (Basilicata, Campania, Molise, Sicilia, Abruzzo, Puglia e Lazio) belong to the second cluster. As reported for the previous group also these regions have a high bed turnover and the number of days between two hospitalization are relatively low. However, .

Also for this reason, even if these regions tend to cope with complex cases and pathologies, their performance is lower than the national one.\\n3) In three regions (Liguria, Toscana e Veneto) hospital beds are not efficiently managed with a low performance in the management of not so complex cases. This is mainly due to the low complexity of cases hospitalized with a length of stay higher than the national average value. In this classification Marche represents an outlier in the management of hospital beds. Differently from the last reported cluster it manages complex cases with a relative high performance. \\nCOVID-19 is one of the most serious respiratory pandemics of the past 100 years, its rapid global spread is overwhelming hospitals and local communities in Italy. One of the main challenges to be faced by the Italian hospitals is to provide hospital beds for patients affected by this virus with a particular attention of the intensive care unit department. This is particularly evident considering that, at the moment, the majority of the northern regions in Italy are suffering with a low number of available beds and that others presumably saturate their capacity in the following days.\\nThe lack of hospital beds has been attributed to a set of important cuts in the financing of public health over the last years that also result in a reduction of hospital beds both in general and in the intensive care units on the whole territory.\\n.

The results of the overall analysis firstly show that even if an important reduction of hospital beds affects the majority of the hospital wards, an opposite trend has been detected for the intensive care unit. This is particularly evident considering the regions that are most effected by the virus: Lombardy +11%, Marche +12%, Piemonte -5%, Trento +55%, Bolzano +3%, Veneto +4%.\\nHospital beds are generally efficiently managed all over the country with some exceptions in the south of Italy that show a slow turnover and/or a low bed occupancy rate. This positive result is particularly evident in the regions of northern Italy where cases are handled with rapid shifts, also without leaving beds empty during the year. Moreover, generally northern regions mainly deal with complex cases albeit with a performance below the national average. On the contrary, different results are displayed analysing the management of beds in the intensive care units, where the 75% occupancy rate threshold is not reached in all regions. In this sense, the northern regions exhibit a high performance, even if related to the management of less complex cases.\\nIn conclusion this study highlights that in the recent years there has been no substation reduction of the hospital beds located in the intensive care units. Differently other wards suffered of the financial cuts done by national and regional governments to the public health. However, this trend may also take into account two important factors. On the one hand, the provision of health services is now shifting from formal institutional facilities (e.g. hospitals) to home care and, on the other hand, different scheduled procedures are mainly provided in a day hospital reducing the number of beds needed to treat the patients. The majority of the Italian regions and in particular those in the northern part of the country can rely on an appropriate number of beds that generally do not saturate in periods when the patient flow is not conditioned by catastrophic events like what we have been going through these weeks. This availability of hospital beds as well as the efficiency in their management confirmed in this study allow hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds. In fact, the analysis reported in this paper showed that, in normal situations, the management of hospital and intensive care beds has no critical levels, while in pandemic or other catastrophic periods, the hospital management paradigms change [18] .

Considering that post-intensive care and intensive care continuously bed availability daily changes across the land and the European countries, it is not possible to apply this methodology in this pandemic period. However, an ex post analysis should be applied in the future to provide indications on the hospital-territory relationship in response to widespread social problems.\\n  "

Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function.

The 5′ UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.\\nMoreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).\\nThe presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication.

       "      <td>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 , which by March 2020 has already spread across more than 80 countries 1 . Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia, often resulting in death 2 . Soon after the first epidemiological data together with SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were made available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries.\\nDespite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. In particular, the US-based NextStrain 3 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford, UK, among others. Recently, an editorial published on Science 6 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data.\\nHence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed.\\n.

We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences deposited on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population ( Figure 1 ). As March 10 th 2020, 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available, almost twice as much than just one week earlier (March 3 rd 2020, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries). Yet, the sampling per country was inhomogeneous, with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes (Spearman correlation = 0.03). Moreover, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country.\\nItaly, for example, the second country per confirmed cases, has uploaded so far only two genomes from Lombardy and three from Lazio (Table S1) , i.e. only two of the twenty Italian regions, all with confirmed cases 9 . China and USA contributed with 123 and 63 genomes respectively (56% combined), while 13 countries contribute with only one or two samples (6.3% combined). Notably, three countries with less than 400 confirmed cases have provided a substantial number of genomes (Netherlands 28, Australia 18, Singapore 11; 17% combined) ( Figure 1 ).\\nThe effect of inhomogeneous sampling and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions, like the ones recently rushed through news and (social) media to claim specific dissemination routes of SARS-CoV-2 among countries, can be quite dramatic. An instructive example is the putative introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy from Germany. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree, inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on March 3 rd , 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1 ), showed a well-supported cluster of European and Asian sequences (reported in Figure 2a ), which contained a subclade (subclade A, Figure 2a ) including a sequence isolated in Germany that .

However, in a new tree inferred just one week later, when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on GISAID 8 ( Figure S2 ), the direct link between Germany and Italy has disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from Portugal, Brazil, Wales and Netherland ( Figure 2b ). Most importantly, there is no sufficient evidence of a higher likelihood (Shimodaira-Hasgawa test, Table 1 ) for tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree (see arrows in Figure 2b) compared to the ML tree inferred from the real data. In other words, it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern (and, therefore, phylogeographic reconstruction)\\nis the most likely.\\nLack of resolution and uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected, considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic, even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving RNA virus. Plots of pairwise transitions/transversions vs. genetic distance 10 showed, indeed, low genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes, considerable scattering, and overlap in transitions and transversions among closely related sequences (Figure 3a ). The 331 full genomes available contained 477 out of 29,564 variable sites (1.6%), of which 377 were singleton and only 100 (0.34%) parsimony informative, indicating a substantial lack of phylogenetic information, and raising the possibility of a number of sequencing errors. Further assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11 , which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences (quartet), randomly .

Quartets are considered \"resolved\" when the three likelihoods are significantly different (phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e. data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include &lt;40% of the unresolved quartets 12 , way lower than the 52.9% unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment ( Figure 3b ). It is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any SARS-CoV-2 tree unreliable, and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution. Finally, the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ML tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal (no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time, Figure 3c ). This is, again, expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak. Bayesian analysis 13 , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate. With more genome sequences sampled from different time points and geographic areas made available, literally, every day, Bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option. However, as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable.\\nTaken together, our observations suggest that any conclusion drawn, at present, about existing lineages and direction of viral spread, based on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, is potentially misleading. Nowadays, published scientific data and media are very easily .

We believe that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Any inference based on phylogenetic trees should be considered at the very best preliminary, and hypothesis-generating.\\nHence the need for 1) avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and 2) continuing the concerted scientific effort to increase the number and quality of available data. The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread will unveil an unprecedented amount of information, which is essential to make policy decisions. The whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic, and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing. Some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant, high quality sequence data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases, such as Italy and South Korea, but also from others that seem to be experiencing, at least for now, a lower number of infections.\\nGISAID was accessed on March 3 rd and 10 th , 2020 (final dataset information reported in Table   S1 ). After quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides, the first dataset (March 3 rd 2020) consisted of 169 genomes from 22 countries, while the second (March 10 th , 2020) 331 from 29 countries.

       "      <td>The 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread across China and 24 other countries 1-3 as of February 8, 2020 . The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.\\nHealthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.\\nThis study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.\\nRecent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.\\nThe Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .\\nThe ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.\\nThe reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>[{'text': 'The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]</td>\n",
       "      <td>The outbreak of infectious diseases has always been one of the most important health problems in the world. With the rapid spread of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , much attention has been paid to subjects like rate of an epidemic, transition ways, prevention methods, and remaining time of the virus in the environment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, the behavior of the virus in relation to environmental factors is critical. The coronavirus is one of the epidemic diseases that many countries have experienced in the new type of it, COVID-19, and can become a serious challenge and affect the previous efforts on sustainable development [6] [7] [8] [9] .\\nIt has been found that there are some delays between the detection of confirmed cases and the actual infection date due to the laboratory test, the time of the announcement of confirmed cases in media, and the time for the patients showing initial symptoms for a total usually of 3 to 5 days [10] [11] [12] . The analysis of Kampf et al. (2020) demonstrated that COVID-19 could remain up to 9 days on different materials based on temperature and humidity [13] . Cascella et al. (2020) conducted research on the new coronavirus structure. Their analysis shows that the virus belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ ssRNA), which has a length of about 30 kb and an envelope with spear structures and they tested the sensitivity of the virus to UV and temperature [14] . investigated the correlations between environmental factors and the number of positive cases of COVID-19 by the use of artificial intelligence techniques. The results of this study put evidence on the role of urban and weather conditions on the epidemic rate [15] . Chen et al. (2020) developed a time-dependent mathematical model for the prediction of the total number of positive cases [16] . Lytle and Sagripanti (2005) studied the impact of UV rays, and their results determined that it can affect the structure of coronaviruses because UV rays could damage the nucleic acids of viral RNA that is vital for the survival of the virus [17] . developed an assessment method for investigating the impact of climate and urban factors in confirmed cases of COVID-19 [18] . Bukhari et al., (2020) , studied the epidemic of COVID-19 on tropical zones and their results show that the highest number of infection happened in temperature among 3 to 17 ºC [19] .\\nThe analysis of Grant and Giovannucci (2009) shows that by increasing the UV, the level of vitamin D in the body increases and makes the infection rates decrease. Therefore, in areas on lower latitudes and closer to the equator line, the epidemic on COVID-19 might be different [20] . In the study of Chan et al. (2011) , the effect of temperature and humidity on SARS coronavirus was analyzed, and they found that increasing temperature decreases the epidemic rate by faster disabling virus structure on contaminated surfaces [21] . Pirouz and Violini (2020) , analyzed the outbreak patterns of COVID-19 by analysis of 117 countries. They suggested two mechanisms of triggering the development of the infection, namely the normal spread of an infection from one parent case and the consequence of a unique phenomenon of accumulation of contagious people [22] . Analysis of the previous studies demonstrates the necessity of further research about the effect of environmental factors on the COVID-19. Since some of the previous researches have shown the effect of weather conditions, especially temperature, on coronavirus viruses, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the better correlation of daily mean air temperature on the epidemic rate of the COVID-19.\\nIn this study, we analysed the number of positive contagions of coronavirus COVID-19, from February 29 th to March 19 th . The selection of February 29 th is due to existence on this date of at least one positive case of COVID-19 in all case studies studied. The analysis of the weather data started from February15 th and ended on March 18 th because the impact of the weather parameter would occur in the upcoming days. Thus, the considered average daily temperature is with an interval of 1 to 14 days before the definitive cases of COVID-19.\\n In order to minimize the impact of other parameters on the results, such as the policy of each government, cultural differences between countries, health care systems, or the protocols in getting coronavirus test, comparative analysis have been done for different regions of the same country, without comparing with each other the results of different countries;  The analysis period for average daily temperature ranges from February15 th , 2020 to March18 th , 2020 (33 days);  The analysis period for confirmed cases of coronavirus COVID-19 is from February 29 th to March19 th ;  For what concerns the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, the total number of confirmed cases in a region was divided into the population of that region in order to take into account the different size of the population in each region.\\nTo carry out the analysis, the datasets of five countries and in each country, of three regions/provinces have been considered. The selected case studies are presented in Table 1 . and the location of the three regions shown in Figures 1. \\nMathematical models have been successfully used for the analysis of many hazards [32, 33] . In complex subjects, different Mathematical models can be used to solve the problem [34] [35] [36] . Statistical tests are an appropriate method for the investigation of possible correlations between different datasets [37] . Many statistical tests can be used for the analysis of significant differences between the datasets, among which F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test [38] .\\nIn order to investigate the hypothesis about a correlation between significant differences (Sig.) of average daily temperatures and average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases in two regions, the following assumptions, and statistical tests have been done:\\n The variances of the two groups are equal: H0  The variances of the two groups are not equal: H1\\n.

Conversely, if the significance level (sig.) is larger than 0.05, the hypothesis H1 is rejected, and the hypothesis H0 is accepted, i.e., the variances of the datasets in the two selected regions are equal.\\nThrough F-test, one determines the presence or absence of differences in the variances of the two regions. Through another statistical test, the Independent-Samples T-Test, one can determine whether the difference is significant, has been used. When using Independent-Samples T-Test, a significance level (sig.) lower (higher) than 0.05, means that the difference is (is not) significant.\\nIn our analysis, we used SPSS software. The critical factors in the SPSS Model set up are as follow:\\n The datasets in different regions of the same countries were analyzed with respect to the average daily air temperature during the 33-day period from 15-Feb to 18-Mar and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the 19 days from 29-Feb to 19-Mar.  In all statistical tests, the confidence level of 95% is considered.  First, the F-test was used to test whether there is a significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies, and then, depending on the F-test result, by the T-Test the existence of a significant difference between the data of the two cases was investigated.\\nThe average daily temperature [39, 40] , and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases [41] , are shown in Figures 2 to 6.\\na. Average daily temperature b. Cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases Correlations between the average temperatures and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases were found especially for towns with significant differences, with respect to the other two towns of the same country, in the average daily temperature. This was the case for Bandar Abas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. The average daily temperature and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases are listed in Table 2 . As a general feature of Table 2 , we notice that  In 11 out of the possible fifteen comparisons, the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is higher when the average daily temperature is lower, and in the four remaining cases the differences in either variable are small.\\nA more specific analysis per country shows that  In Iran, the average daily temperature in Bandar Abbas was the highest (21.54 ºC), and the average cumulative rate of daily of confirmed cases was the lowest (0.000027). .

However, the comparison of Santa Cruz with higher average daily temperatures shows a slower spread of COVID-19.  In the United States, the average daily air temperature in both New York and Seattle are lower than Los Angeles, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases shows the spread of the virus in both is faster than in Los Angeles.\\nThese qualitative results reflect in the statistical analysis of the data by F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test presented in Table 3 .

From the F-test, the F value is equal to 20.4. The criterion for variance equality in the F-test is that the F value must smaller than the critical F value. The statistical analysis has been done on a statistical confidence level of 95%, and therefore the error level is 0.05, and considering the degrees of freedom, the critical F value of the test that can be found through F distribution tables [42] , in this case, is equal to F = 1.57. Since the F value we found is 20.4, larger than the critical F value, the assumption of the equality of variances is rejected. It means that the average temperature variance of the Ramsar and Tehran are not equal.\\nAccording to the t-test, the t value for these two cities is equal to -1.929. Based on an error level of 0.05 and by considering the degrees of freedom, the critical values of the test indicated in the T distribution tables [43] , is in this case equal to t = ± 1.645. Since the t value is out of the critical boundary (-1.645 ≤ acceptable t ≤ +1.645), the assumption of equality in the averages is rejected, and the existence of difference in averages is confirmed. Thus from two tests, it is evident that there is a significant difference between the average temperature of the two cities of Ramsar and Tehran.\\nAn analogous result holds for the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.\\nThe main results of Table 4 , with a confidence level of 95% are as follow:\\n In Iran, the city of Bandar Abbas is significantly different from Ramsar and Tehran in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.  In Italy, the city of Milan is significantly different from Rome and Naples in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases. Instead, the two cities of Rome and Napoli are not significantly different in terms of these variables.  In Germany, there are no significant differences in average daily temperature in all three cities, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different.  In Spain, Barcelona and Valencia are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different. However, in Barcelona and Santa Cruz, the average daily temperature is significantly different, as well as the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, and the same trend exists between Valencia and Santa Cruz.  In the United States, the two cities of New York and Seattle are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and of the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, the number of patients is not significantly different. Instead, the city of Los Angeles is significantly different in terms of average daily temperature with two cities of New York and Seattle, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases are different significantly.\\nThe results of our analysis of daily air temperature for three case studies from five countries showed the existence of correlations between the average temperatures and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when the differences in average daily temperature are larger. For example, in Iran and Italy, the regions with lower average daily temperature had a higher epidemic level of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , and the same trend exists in all other case studies.\\nThe statistical analysis showed that in all the case studies we considered, referring to five different countries, if there is a significant difference in daily mean temperature, there is also a significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, supporting the proposed research hypothesis about the correlation between air temperature and the epidemic rates of COVID-19. Due to the correlations among temperature and hours of sunshine for future research, it is recommended to study the effects of the sun's UV rays as well as the average hours of sunshine on the epidemic rates of COVID-19.\\nThis study analyzed the possible correlation of daily average air temperature with the epidemic rate of the coronavirus (COVID-19) using significant differences analysis between the datasets. The research hypothesis is that in regions with a significant difference in the average daily temperature, the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases would also is different significantly. Conversely, to the absence of a significant difference in daily temperature, would correspond no significant difference in the rate of confirmed cases. The hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately. This comparison using statistical analysis through F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test of the daily temperatures and daily rate of confirmed cases shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.\\n.

In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species.

       "      <td>Metagenomic sequencing, which allows us to directly obtain total genomic DNAs from host-associated and environmental samples, has led to important findings in many areas, such as digestive health [1] . While bacteria are the main focus of most metagenomic sequencing projects, there are fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data with sequencing viruses as the main purpose [2] . There are different types of viruses. We are mainly concerned with RNA viruses because many RNA viruses are notorious human pathogens, such as Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, SARS-CoV, and recently identified 2019-nCoV causing Wuhan pneumonia. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. This high genetic diversity within and across different hosts poses a great challenge for designing long-term protection strategies against these infectious diseases. For example, as the circulating strains can change every year, flu vaccine has to be administered every year.\\nAdvances in viral metagenomics have contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. According to a survey by Woolhouse et. al, the number of newly identified RNA viruses is changing from 1,899 in 2005 to 5,561 in 2018, which is 3 times of increase [3] . Largescale RNA virus sequencing projects using nextgeneration sequencing technologies have been conducted for different species. For example, Shi et al. have discovered a large number of new RNA viruses by sequencing samples from invertebrate and vertebrate animals [4, 5] . Claire et al. have discovered 25 new RNA viruses by sequencing samples associated with different drosophilid [6] . Bolduc et al. sequenced RNA viruses from Archaeal and bacterial samples [7] . Given fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data and expected discovery of new viruses, a key step is to conduct composition analysis for these data and assign taxonomic groups for possibly new species.\\nComposition analysis can be conducted at the read level or contig level. There is no doubt that contigs can provide more information than short reads in taxonomic classification. However, metagenomic assembly is still one of the most challenging computational problems in bioinformatics. Unlike single genome assembly, metagenomic assembly is more likely to produce chimeric contigs that can contain regions from different species. Thus, metagenomic assembly is often preceded by read binning that groups reads with the same or similar taxonomic labels [8] in order to achieve better performance.\\nIn this work, we design a read level taxonomic classification tool (named as \"CHEER\") for labeling new species in viral metagenomic data. To detect known species with available reference genomes, alignment-based methods can provide sufficient information for both classification and abundance estimation. This function has been incorporated in existing pipelines [9, 10, 11] and is thus not the focus of our tool. Instead, our tool is designed to handle the challenging cases of assigning taxonomic labels for reads of new species, which have not been observed before. This problem was clearly formulated in metagenomic phylogenetic classification tools such as Phymm and PhymmBL [8] . We first define the classification problem following the formulation in Phymm: the classification problem is the assignment of a phylogenetic group label to each read in input data sets. As we are only interested in the hard case of classifying reads of new species, which have not been sequenced and thus no label exists for these species, the expected labels for these reads are the higher-rank taxonomic groups such as genus, family, or order. All our data and experiments are designed so that the test species are masked in the reference database and the trained models.\\nPrevious experiments have shown that nucleotide-level homology search is not sensitive enough for assigning higher rank taxonomic groups to reads from new species [9, 10] . Protein-based homology search is thus preferred for phylogenetic classification [11, 12] . In particular, a recent tool, VirusSeeker [13] utilized BLASTx to classify reads into bacteria, phages, and other viruses. It is not clear whether the protein homology search is able to generate accurate classification at lower ranks. We will evaluate this in our experiments.\\nThere are also alignment-free methods for phylogenetic classification. Many of those tools implemented different machine learning models and were mainly designed for bacteria. For example, RDP [14] adopted a Naïve Bayes based classifier that can automatically learn features from the reads and assigned taxonomic labels to sequences from bacterial and archaeal 16S genes and fungal 28S genes. The NBC classifier [15, 16] encoded metagenomic reads using k-mers and implemented a bag-of-word model to achieve the readlevel taxonomic classification. Phymm [8] utilized interpolated Markov models (IMMs) for metagenomic read classification. These learning-based models enable users to label reads originating from new species.\\nThe previous works have shown that sequence composition is still an important and informative feature for phylogenetic classification. Recent applications of deep learning models have achieved better performance than conventional machine learning methods in different sequence classification problems [17] . In particular, the convolution filters in Convolutional Neural Network models (CNN) can represent degenerated sequence motifs and thus help CNN models to learn abstract composition-based features. For example, frequently activated convolution filters learned by DeepFam often represented the conserved motifs in different protein domain families [18] . The successful applications of deep learning in sequence classification motivated us to design a novel deep learning-based classification model for assigning taxonomic groups for new species in viral metagenomic data.\\nOur main contributions are summarized below. First, our deep learning model can assign higher rank phylogenetic group labels (such as genus) for reads from new species. To achieve this goal, our model organizes multiple CNN-based classifiers in a tree for hierarchical taxonomic group assignment. Second, to enable our model to capture as much information as possible from short reads, we implemented and compared two encoding methods: one hot vs. embedding. Third, as viral metagenomic data usually contains contaminations from either the host genomes or other microbes, we formulated the pre-processing step as an open set problem in targeted image classification and rejected non-viral reads by choosing appropriate negative training sets. We tested our model on both simulated metagenomic data and also real sequencing data. The results show that our model competes favorably with other popular methods.\\nIn this section, we will introduce our method for viral metagenomic taxonomic classification. First, we will show the architecture of CHEER, which is a hierarchical classification model from order to genus. Second, classifiers at each level will be described. Third, we will introduce DNA sequence encoding using skipgram based word embedding and compare it with onehot encoding. Forth, we will describe the rejection layer, following the idea of the open set problem, which is adopted to filter reads not belonging to RNA viruses. Finally, we will detail our dataset used in training and validation.\\nThe architecture of our model is sketched in Fig. 1. The key component is a tree model that consists of multiple classifiers from order to genus. In order to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species, or even new genus, our classification is conducted using a top-down approach from the root to the leaf node. The top layer is a trained CNN that can reject reads not belonging to RNA viruses, which is an important preprocessing step for viral metagenomic data because of the contamination from the host genome or other microbes. Then, the filtered reads (i.e. mostly RNA viral reads) will be fed into the hierarchical classification model, which is referred to as the tree model hereafter. Specifically, the order-level classifier is responsible for classifying the reads into their originating orders. Then each order has a separately trained classifier for assigning input reads to families within that order (O1 to O3 in Fig. 1 ). For all the reads assigned into one family, the family classifier (F1-F7) will assign the reads to different genus within that family. As an example, a path for classifying a read from a species in genus 7 is highlighted in Fig. 1 . CHEER also implemented early stop functions at each level for stopping the classification path at higher ranks. This function can accommodate taxonomic classification for species from new genus or even higher ranks, which is possible for RNA viruses. It is convenient to add fine-grained classifiers within each genus so that we can assign species-level labels. However, as our focus is to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species that do not have a species labels in the training data, we did not include the species-level assignment in this work.\\nAlternative designs of hierarchical classification work, like [19, 20] , either build a classifier for each taxonomic rank or build a binary classifier for each class. We implemented a structure that built just one classifier for each taxonomic rank and compared different structures' performance. According to the result shown in [Supplementary file 1], the structure shown in Fig.1 is better than one classifier per rank. Although one classifier per rank requires fewer classifiers, it needs to train many more parameters because the number of labels for each classifier increases by times. As a result, we observe overfitting more frequently.\\nEach classifier in the tree model is implemented using CNN, which has achieved superior performance in various sequence classification problems [18] . The convolution filters used in CNN resemble positionspecific weight matrix of motifs in genomic sequences. Frequently activated convolution filters can represent well-conserved motifs among sequences in the same class. Thus, a large number of convolution filters will be used in our CNN in order to learn well-conserved sequence features in different classes. Deep CNNs in fields such as computer vision often have multiple convolution layers in order to obtain more abstract features from training images. Here, we use a wide convolution design rather than a deep one, following the idea in [18] . Fig. 2 shows the classifier with the default hyper-parameters. First, reads will be encoded in matrices as input to the convolution layer using two methods. We will describe and compare these two encoding methods later in the Section 2.3. Then, multiple convolution filters of different sizes are utilized to learn the conserved sequence features. According to our empirical study, we choose 3, 7, 11, 15 as the filter sizes, with 256 filters for each size respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Max pooling is then applied to each convolution filter's output so that only the highest convolution value is kept. After the max-pooling layer, we have a 256-dimentional vector as the output of each convolution layer. We concatenate these four vectors into one 1024-dimentional vector and feed it to one fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting. The CrossEntropyLoss function supplied by Pytorch is adopted as an error estimation function. Due to the unbalanced size of each training class, we use the reciprocal of the proportion of each class as their error weight to help the model fairly learn from each class. And we utilize Adam optimizer with a 0.001 learning rate to update the parameters. The model is trained on HPCC with the 2080Ti GPU unit. \\nIn previous deep learning-based sequence classification models [21, 22] , one hot encoding was commonly adopted to convert a sequence into a matrix, which will then be used as input to convolution layers. There also exist some methods using k-mer composition [23] and frequency [15, 16] to encode the DNA sequence, similar to the bag-of-words model in the field of natural language processing. However, these k-mers representation cannot give complete sequential information about the original reads.\\nTo incorporate both the k-mer composition and also their ordering information, we build a Skip-Gram [24] based embedding layer that can learn which k-mers tend to occur close to each other. Embedding is widely used in natural language processing to learn the semantic and syntactic relationships from sentences. A neural network with one hidden layer is trained to map a word to an n-dimensional vector so that the words that usually occur together will be closer in the n-dimension space. For our DNA read classification task, k-mers are the words and the embedding layer will map proximate kmers into vectors of high similarity. The main hyper-parameter when training the skip-gram model is the size of the training context m, which defines the maximum context location at which the furthest k-mer is taken for training. Specifically, for a kmer at position i as the input to the skip-gram model, the output k-mers are its neighbors located at i+jk, where −m ≤ ≤ m. Larger m results in more training samples with a cost of training time. In our model, the default value of m is 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , we will sample 3 k-mers as our dataset at a time with the middle one as the input and the surrounding two as the output.\\nAs proven in [24] , Skip-Gram is able to automatically learn the relationship between proximate words and thus is expected to help learn the order between k-mers in genomic data. We implemented a hidden layer with 100 hidden units shown in Fig. 3 . After training the model, the co-occurrence features are embedded in the output of the hidden layer. Thus, a k-mer in a read will be represented as a 100-dimension vector, where each element in the vector is the output of the hidden unit in the hidden layer.\\nWhen we use this pre-trained embedding layer to encode the reads, we first split each read into sequential k-mers. Second, each k-mer is fed to the embedding layer and the output is a 100-dimension vector. Third, all these vectors are combined into a large matrix according to the original position of each k-mers. Finally, this matrix will be fed to the convolutional layer.\\nBased on our large-scale experiments, we found that classifiers are easy to overfit with increase of k. Thus, we choose 100-dimensional feature vectors with k being 3 as our default embedding layer parameter set based on our empirical analysis.\\nDue to the small genome size and limitations in library construction, it is not rare that many viral metagenomic datasets are still contaminated with the genomes of the host and other microbes. Viral read screening is thus a key pre-processing step before the downstream composition analysis. Specifically, our tree model should only be applied to viral reads. However, the close set nature of the classifier forces it to assign a known label to each input without being able to distinguish viral reads from others. In this work, we will reject non-viral reads by formulating it as an open set problem in targeted image classification [25] .\\nIn a majority of neural network models [26, 27] , the logit of the last layer will be fed into the SoftMax function, which takes a vector of n real numbers as input and output a normalized probability vector for all labels/classes. However, for an irrelevant input from an unknown clade, all classes in the model tend to have low probabilities and thus applying a threshold on uncertainty can be used to reject unknown classes [25] . Along with this idea, serval approaches [28, 29] have been proposed to solve the open set problem.\\nIn this work, we incorporate the pre-processing step in our hierarchical classification model by integrating a trained CNN and a SoftMax threshold. Contaminations such as bacteria will be rejected using empirically chosen SoftMax threshold τ. Our experiments show that SoftMax outputs a nearly uniform probability distribution of all labels if the input is not relevant. Thus, the SoftMax threshold τ is used to reject reads not belonging to either DNA or RNA viruses. However, using this thresholding method is not able to distinguish DNA viral reads from RNA viral reads due to their similar sequence composition. To accommodate this challenge, we designed a rejection classifier in the top layer using DNA viral reads as the negative class in the training (see Fig. 1 ).\\nAs the focus of our work is to assign labels for new species, the hierarchical classification ends at genuslevel assignment, which is conducted by the bottom layer in Fig. 1 . Given the fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data, there are cases where a new species does not belong to any existing genus and thus the label assignment should stop at the higher ranks. Thus, we allow our model to stop at a higher rank in the tree during the top-down classification. Towards this goal, we still apply SoftMax threshold in our early stop function, which stops reads from further classification by the child classifiers. This early stop function also serves as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications if the confidence is low. For example, when a read arrives, the model may be able to identify its order and family labels with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. In this case, the model should only assign order and family label to this read rather than classifying it into a potentially wrong genus. To achieve this goal, SoftMax threshold is applied for every classifier in the tree. Only reads with a score higher than the threshold will be assigned to the child class.\\nAn example of early stop is highlighted by the yellow path in Fig. 1 . The model can classify the read into order 2 (O2) and then family 4 (F4) with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to.\\nAll the viruses used in the experiments were obtained from the RefSeq in the NCBI virus database. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009001 doi: bioRxiv preprint viruses' taxonomic classification was downloaded from Virus Taxonomy 2018b Release [30] published by the International Committee on Taxonomic of Virus (ICVT). Because training deep learning classifiers required enough samples, we removed the orders with only one family, families with only one genus, and genera with less than 3 species from our dataset. Finally, there are 6 orders, 23 families, and 55 genera remained. The RefSeq genomes are available at the following URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/fi nd-data/virus. The information of the taxa can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. As CHEER conducts read-level taxonomic classification, the training is also conducted using reads. In order to train our model on each complete virus genome, we generated simulated reads by uniformly extracting substrings of 250 bp with 200bp overlaps. All these reads formed the training set so that the model can learn the features from the whole genome. The validation set, however, is generated by read simulation tool WgSim [31] with specified error rate so that we can have a better estimation of the model's performance on real sequencing data. Some existing deep learning tools for taxonomic classification, like [21, 23] , generate reads first, then randomly choose some of them as training set and others as testing set. This strategy cannot guarantee that the training and testing data sets have no overlaps from the same species. In order to test whether our model can learn the label of new species, we use test species masking in the training set. Specifically, we split our RNA virus database into two independent sets. For any test species, their reads are not used in the training data. Thus, the model will only use the knowledge of known species for the new species classification.\\nIn this section, we will first give details of the hyperparameters of CHEER. Then we present the results of applying CHEER to both simulated and mock sequencing data. For the simulated data by WgSim, we evaluated how sequencing error rate affects the performance of CHEER and compared the taxonomic classification results with state-of-the-art. For the mock data, we tested CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and its ability in distinguishing viral reads from others.\\nIn our experiments, the minimum number of species within a genus is 3. We thus constructed three test sets, each containing reads from one species that is randomly chosen from each genus. The three test sets contain three different species, respectively. In total, 165 species from 55 genera are chosen to be \"new\" species for testing and the information of these species can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nWe used WgSim to simulate reads from testing species. In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing error on CHEER, we simulated reads with an error rate of 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively. For each classifier (CNN), we computed the classification accuracy, which is defined in equation (1). To ensure that the computation of the accuracy is not affected by the number of reads from different species, we constructed a balanced test read set by simulating the same number of reads for each test species (1,000 reads for each). (1) For each component classifier in the tree model, we record the average accuracy for multiple test species. For each taxa level, we calculate the average accuracy of all the classifiers in the same level.\\nWe present the results of CHEER at each level in this section. Because CHEER is designed for new species, we benchmark it against alignment-free models. Based on the results shown by Wood et al. [7] , Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) outperformed other alignment-free models. Thus, we compared the performance of CHEER and NBC. NBC in [14] was designed for bacteria taxonomic classification and thus, we retrained NBC on our RNA virus dataset. We implemented the NBC model following [14] with the same parameters. Since each family has a separately trained classifier, which conducts genus classification within that family, there are totally 14 classifiers at this level. Fig. 5 shows the accuracy for labeling families. There are totally 6 classifiers that assign reads to families within each of the 6 orders. Fig. 6 shows the mean accuracy at each rank. The family and genus level accuracy are the average accuracy of all classifiers in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . There is only one classifier for order level classification.\\nAs shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 , CHEER has better performance than NBC across different ranks. We also compared the performance of using one-hot encoding and embedding layer in CHEER. The performance comparison at each rank shows that for most of the classifiers, the embedding layer improves the learning ability. Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 also revealed the robustness of CHEER. Although the classification accuracy decreases as the error rate increases, the decrease is smaller than 2%. The accuracy is almost identical for many classifiers. Thus, CHEER is not very sensitive to sequencing errors. We also conducted experiments for reads with higher error rates (0.02 and 0.05). The results can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nThe next experiment is to evaluate our model on a real sequencing dataset and test CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and non-viral read rejection. We built a mock dataset by mixing Ebolavirus reads with gut bacterial reads from a gut amplicon sequencing dataset, which is chosen to ensure that we only use reads from bacteria. The taxonomic classification of Zaire Ebolavirus in the tree model is highlighted in Fig. 7 . We chose one of the Ebola species named Zaire Ebolavirus as our testing species because it is the most dangerous of the five Ebolavirus species and was responsible for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We downloaded the dataset from NCBI with accession number SRR1930021. These reads were sequenced by Illumina using whole-genome amplification strategy. Since Zaire Ebolavirus usually causes fatal hemorrhagic fever and abdominal pain, it is possible that this Ebola virus occurs with other gut bacteria. Thus, we created a mock viral metagenomic data by mixing these Ebola reads with a gut bacteria amplicon sequencing data in order to test whether CHEER can reject the bacterial reads at the top rejection layer. The gut bacteria dataset is downloaded from NCBI with accession number: SRR10714026. There are totally 2,737 Ebola virus reads and 51,280 gut bacterial reads in the mock data. After the rejection layer, the Ebola reads will be used to evaluate our tree model.\\nTo treat Zaire Ebolavirus as a \"new\" species, we removed its genome from our training set and re-trained the whole pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7 , after removing this species, we still have four Ebola species in our training set. However, our read mapping experiment using Bowtie2 [32] showed that none of the reads from Zaire Ebolavirus can be mapped to other Ebola species with the default parameters, indicating that using usual alignment-based methods will have difficulty to conduct genus-level assignment.\\nIn our work, CHEER will first use rejection layer to remove the reads not belonging to the RNA virus. Second, the \"Order classifier\" will be applied to evaluate how many reads can be classified into Mononegavirales order. Third, \"Mononegavirales classifier\" takes all these Mononegavirales reads as input to predict how many reads will be assigned to the Filoviridae family. Finally, \"Filoviridae classifier\" is adopted to check how many reads belong to the Ebola genus. Fig. 8 show the ROC curve of the rejection layer. True positive rate reveals how many Ebolavirus reads pass the rejection layer. The false positive rate reveals how many gut bacterial reads pass the rejection layer. We generated thresholds from 0 to 1 with step size 0.01 and used each threshold for the rejection layer. Then for each threshold, we recorded the true positive rate and false positive rate for plotting the ROC curve. As shown in Fig. 8 , with the increase of the threshold, more bacterial reads are filtered by the rejection layer, at the expense of missing more real Ebola reads. The default threshold for the rejection layer is 0.6 in CHEER. User can adjust the threshold according to their needs.\\nAfter evaluating the rejection layer, we continued to test the hierarchical classification performance at each rank. We first compared our tree model with NBC. Then we also benchmarked CHEER with the method using protein-level alignment in Section 3.3.3. The performance of the complete hierarchical classification pipeline of NBC and CHEER is shown in Fig. 9 . From order to genus, each bar shows the accuracy of correctly classified reads by the parent classifier. For example, NBC correctly classified 1580 at the order level. Then, 1564 out of the 1580 reads are correctly labeled at the family level. While Fig. 4 , 5, and 6 have shown the performance of CHEER and NBC at each taxonomic rank using the same set of reads as input for each level of classifiers, this experiment focused on comparing the hierarchical classification pipeline using only correctly predicted reads by the parent classifier. The results demonstrated that CHEER can classify Ebola reads with better performance. NBC can only classify 1,564 (57.1%) reads into Ebolavirus. CHEER, however, had totally 2407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly.\\nAlthough nucleotide-level alignment models are not ideal choices for predicting new species, as mentioned in [8] , protein-level alignment such as BLASTx is still frequently used for homology search because of the conservation among homologous protein sequences. We followed VirusSeeker [10] , which is a BLASTx based model, to align translated reads to virus-only protein database (VIRUSDB NR) provided by NCBI. Then, we kept alignments with E-value cutoff 0.001, which is used in VirusSeeker. The output of BLASTx shows that a read can often align to multiple proteins, making the phylogenetic classification ambiguous (see Fig. 11 ). Also, existing tools such as VirusSeeker often use the best alignment only, which does not always yield the highest accuracy. To optimize the usage of the alignment-based method, we implemented k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm to record the best k alignments rather than only using the best one. The label of the input read is determined by the majority vote in the labels of the top k alignments. According to Fig. 10 , most of the reads have hit numbers between 11 to 15 and 6 to10. Thus, we chose 1, 5, 10, 15 as our k when running kNN. There are also 512 reads that cannot be aligned with any VIRUSDB protein sequence. All these reads will be regarded as wrong prediction. Fig. 11 shows the classification results of kNN. When we use the best hit as the prediction the accuracy is only 64%. The best performance of kNN will be 74% with 2,026 correct predictions when k is 5. But the accuracy sharply decreases if k is larger than 5. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 also revealed that it is hard for users to choose a proper k in real classification tasks. The most common value of the hit number is 11-15 shown in Fig. 11 . The best kNN result, however, has a k equal to 5. Thus, comparing to this alignment-based method, CHEER, with 2,407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly, is more practical and reliable.\\nThe two main purposes of the early stop function are: 1) to handle the cases of a new species from an unseen genus or higher ranks; 2) to serve as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications in child classifiers. As Fig. 6 shows, the higher rank classification tends to be more accurate than lower ranks. Because the genus of Ebolavirus exists in our classification tree, the evaluation of the early stop function focuses on the second purpose. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of how many reads are classified into Ebolavirus genus correctly for different classifiers. By allowing early stop, the number of wrong predictions decreased sharply. In short, although there are fewer reads being labelled at the genus level, the total number of reads with wrong classification is decreased. Thus, this is still a useful feature provided by CHEER.\\nAnother significant advantage of CHEER is the high classification speed. Although training the model uses heavy computing resources, the inference procedure of this algorithm is fast. And with the help of GPU acceleration, the training time also decreases a lot.\\nIn the experiments shown in Section 3.4, it takes around 46 minutes to run BLASTx against the virus protein database. Our method, however, only takes 7 second for the preprocessing step to convert the raw sequence into a vector, and then takes less than 35 second to make the prediction for all 2,737 reads.\\nIn this work, all training data are RNA virus genomes downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq database. The training reads are extracted uniformly from the genome to make sure that classifiers can learn the features from the whole genome. To evaluate the model on new species detection, all species in the test set are excluded from the training data. Error rates are also added to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results reveal that the model is tolerant to the sequencing error. In addition, a SoftMax threshold rejection layer is applied to filter reads from non-RNA viruses. The SoftMax threshold in each classifier will also help early stop classification with low confidence and thus decreases the wrong predication rate. We show a case study on real-world data to identify how this threshold will influence the rejection classifier and early stop function. The results show that CHEER competes favorably with state-of-the-art tools.\\n</td>\n",

Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases.

However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignmentbased and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools. The source code, scripts, and pre-trained parameters for CHEER are available via GitHub: https://github.com/KennthShang/CHEER.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

The first 360 nucleotides at the 5′ 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) .

Although replicons and full-length genomes lacking PKs were 106 replication-competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one 107 PK copy. This is consistent with our earlier report describing the presence of putative 108 packaging signals in the PK region (22). 109 110 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Plasmid construction. 117 The FMDV replicon plasmids, pRep-ptGFP, and the replication-defective polymerase mutant 118 control, 3D-GNN, have already been described (10).\\nTo introduce mutations into the PK region, the pRep-ptGFP replicon plasmid was digested 121 with SpeI and KpnI and the resulting fragment inserted into a sub-cloning vector (pBluescript) 122 to create the pBluescript PK. PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using ΔPK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3′ end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using ΔPK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer. The modified PK sequences were removed from 130 the sub-cloning vectors and inserted into the pRep-ptGFP plasmid using NheI-HF and KpnI-131 HF.\\n132 133 author/funder. All rights reserved.

As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.\\nChanging the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder.

The 5′ UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.\\nMoreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).\\nThe presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

       "1  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 , which by March 2020 has already spread across more than 80 countries 1 . Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia, often resulting in death 2 . Soon after the first epidemiological data together with SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were made available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries.\\nDespite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. In particular, the US-based NextStrain 3 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford, UK, among others. Recently, an editorial published on Science 6 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data.\\nHence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed.\\n.

We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences deposited on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population ( Figure 1 ). As March 10 th 2020, 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available, almost twice as much than just one week earlier (March 3 rd 2020, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries). Yet, the sampling per country was inhomogeneous, with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes (Spearman correlation = 0.03). Moreover, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country.\\nItaly, for example, the second country per confirmed cases, has uploaded so far only two genomes from Lombardy and three from Lazio (Table S1) , i.e. only two of the twenty Italian regions, all with confirmed cases 9 . China and USA contributed with 123 and 63 genomes respectively (56% combined), while 13 countries contribute with only one or two samples (6.3% combined). Notably, three countries with less than 400 confirmed cases have provided a substantial number of genomes (Netherlands 28, Australia 18, Singapore 11; 17% combined) ( Figure 1 ).\\nThe effect of inhomogeneous sampling and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions, like the ones recently rushed through news and (social) media to claim specific dissemination routes of SARS-CoV-2 among countries, can be quite dramatic. An instructive example is the putative introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy from Germany. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree, inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on March 3 rd , 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1 ), showed a well-supported cluster of European and Asian sequences (reported in Figure 2a ), which contained a subclade (subclade A, Figure 2a ) including a sequence isolated in Germany that .

However, in a new tree inferred just one week later, when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on GISAID 8 ( Figure S2 ), the direct link between Germany and Italy has disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from Portugal, Brazil, Wales and Netherland ( Figure 2b ). Most importantly, there is no sufficient evidence of a higher likelihood (Shimodaira-Hasgawa test, Table 1 ) for tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree (see arrows in Figure 2b) compared to the ML tree inferred from the real data. In other words, it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern (and, therefore, phylogeographic reconstruction)\\nis the most likely.\\nLack of resolution and uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected, considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic, even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving RNA virus. Plots of pairwise transitions/transversions vs. genetic distance 10 showed, indeed, low genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes, considerable scattering, and overlap in transitions and transversions among closely related sequences (Figure 3a ). The 331 full genomes available contained 477 out of 29,564 variable sites (1.6%), of which 377 were singleton and only 100 (0.34%) parsimony informative, indicating a substantial lack of phylogenetic information, and raising the possibility of a number of sequencing errors. Further assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11 , which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences (quartet), randomly .

Quartets are considered \"resolved\" when the three likelihoods are significantly different (phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e. data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include <40% of the unresolved quartets 12 , way lower than the 52.9% unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment ( Figure 3b ). It is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any SARS-CoV-2 tree unreliable, and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution. Finally, the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ML tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal (no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time, Figure 3c ). This is, again, expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak. Bayesian analysis 13 , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate. With more genome sequences sampled from different time points and geographic areas made available, literally, every day, Bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option. However, as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable.\\nTaken together, our observations suggest that any conclusion drawn, at present, about existing lineages and direction of viral spread, based on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, is potentially misleading. Nowadays, published scientific data and media are very easily .

We believe that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Any inference based on phylogenetic trees should be considered at the very best preliminary, and hypothesis-generating.\\nHence the need for 1) avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and 2) continuing the concerted scientific effort to increase the number and quality of available data. The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread will unveil an unprecedented amount of information, which is essential to make policy decisions. The whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic, and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing. Some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant, high quality sequence data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases, such as Italy and South Korea, but also from others that seem to be experiencing, at least for now, a lower number of infections.\\nGISAID was accessed on March 3 rd and 10 th , 2020 (final dataset information reported in Table   S1 ). After quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides, the first dataset (March 3 rd 2020) consisted of 169 genomes from 22 countries, while the second (March 10 th , 2020) 331 from 29 countries. Confirmed cases were retrieved for the same day from interactive web-based dashboard developed by Johns Hopkins University 14 .\\nTransition/transversions vs. genetic distance plot were calculated using DAMBE6 10 .

ML tree reconstruction was performed in IQ-TREE based on the best-fit model chosen according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 15, 16 . Topology was tested performing the Shimodaira-Hasegawa 17 on \"Subclade A\" by comparing the inferred tree to three trees where two branches: (Tree 1) Italy (EPI_ISL_412973) switched with Wales (EPI_ISL_413555), (Tree 2) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862 with) Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 3) and Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648) with Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 4) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862) with Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648). All tests performed 10,000 resamplings using the using the RELL approximation method 18 . Position of these genomes within \"Subclade A\" is indicated in Figure 1 with an arrow.\\nExploration of temporal structure, i.e. presence of molecular clock in the data, was assessed by regression of divergence -root-to-tip genetic distance-against sampling time using TempEst 19 . In this case, absence of a linear trend indicates that the data does not contain temporal signal and that the data is not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models.\\nAncestral state reconstruction of full datasets reported in Figures S1 and S2 were based on the ML tree obtained with IQ-TREE and performed using TreeTime 20 . We choose to show the \"European subclade\" and \"Subclade A\" as cladograms in Figure 1 as there are no phylogenetic and temporal signals in the datasets: scaling phylogenies in time or nucleotide substitution in this case is misleading. .

       "2  The 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread across China and 24 other countries 1-3 as of February 8, 2020 . The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.\\nHealthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.\\nThis study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.\\nRecent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.\\nThe Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .\\nThe ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.\\nThe reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. \\n

       "3  The outbreak of infectious diseases has always been one of the most important health problems in the world. With the rapid spread of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , much attention has been paid to subjects like rate of an epidemic, transition ways, prevention methods, and remaining time of the virus in the environment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, the behavior of the virus in relation to environmental factors is critical. The coronavirus is one of the epidemic diseases that many countries have experienced in the new type of it, COVID-19, and can become a serious challenge and affect the previous efforts on sustainable development [6] [7] [8] [9] .\\nIt has been found that there are some delays between the detection of confirmed cases and the actual infection date due to the laboratory test, the time of the announcement of confirmed cases in media, and the time for the patients showing initial symptoms for a total usually of 3 to 5 days [10] [11] [12] . The analysis of Kampf et al. (2020) demonstrated that COVID-19 could remain up to 9 days on different materials based on temperature and humidity [13] . Cascella et al. (2020) conducted research on the new coronavirus structure. Their analysis shows that the virus belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ ssRNA), which has a length of about 30 kb and an envelope with spear structures and they tested the sensitivity of the virus to UV and temperature [14] . investigated the correlations between environmental factors and the number of positive cases of COVID-19 by the use of artificial intelligence techniques. The results of this study put evidence on the role of urban and weather conditions on the epidemic rate [15] . Chen et al. (2020) developed a time-dependent mathematical model for the prediction of the total number of positive cases [16] . Lytle and Sagripanti (2005) studied the impact of UV rays, and their results determined that it can affect the structure of coronaviruses because UV rays could damage the nucleic acids of viral RNA that is vital for the survival of the virus [17] . developed an assessment method for investigating the impact of climate and urban factors in confirmed cases of COVID-19 [18] . Bukhari et al., (2020) , studied the epidemic of COVID-19 on tropical zones and their results show that the highest number of infection happened in temperature among 3 to 17 ºC [19] .\\nThe analysis of Grant and Giovannucci (2009) shows that by increasing the UV, the level of vitamin D in the body increases and makes the infection rates decrease. Therefore, in areas on lower latitudes and closer to the equator line, the epidemic on COVID-19 might be different [20] . In the study of Chan et al. (2011) , the effect of temperature and humidity on SARS coronavirus was analyzed, and they found that increasing temperature decreases the epidemic rate by faster disabling virus structure on contaminated surfaces [21] . Pirouz and Violini (2020) , analyzed the outbreak patterns of COVID-19 by analysis of 117 countries. They suggested two mechanisms of triggering the development of the infection, namely the normal spread of an infection from one parent case and the consequence of a unique phenomenon of accumulation of contagious people [22] . Analysis of the previous studies demonstrates the necessity of further research about the effect of environmental factors on the COVID-19. Since some of the previous researches have shown the effect of weather conditions, especially temperature, on coronavirus viruses, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the better correlation of daily mean air temperature on the epidemic rate of the COVID-19.\\nIn this study, we analysed the number of positive contagions of coronavirus COVID-19, from February 29 th to March 19 th . The selection of February 29 th is due to existence on this date of at least one positive case of COVID-19 in all case studies studied. The analysis of the weather data started from February15 th and ended on March 18 th because the impact of the weather parameter would occur in the upcoming days. Thus, the considered average daily temperature is with an interval of 1 to 14 days before the definitive cases of COVID-19.\\n In order to minimize the impact of other parameters on the results, such as the policy of each government, cultural differences between countries, health care systems, or the protocols in getting coronavirus test, comparative analysis have been done for different regions of the same country, without comparing with each other the results of different countries;  The analysis period for average daily temperature ranges from February15 th , 2020 to March18 th , 2020 (33 days);  The analysis period for confirmed cases of coronavirus COVID-19 is from February 29 th to March19 th ;  For what concerns the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, the total number of confirmed cases in a region was divided into the population of that region in order to take into account the different size of the population in each region.\\nTo carry out the analysis, the datasets of five countries and in each country, of three regions/provinces have been considered. The selected case studies are presented in Table 1 . and the location of the three regions shown in Figures 1. \\nMathematical models have been successfully used for the analysis of many hazards [32, 33] . In complex subjects, different Mathematical models can be used to solve the problem [34] [35] [36] . Statistical tests are an appropriate method for the investigation of possible correlations between different datasets [37] . Many statistical tests can be used for the analysis of significant differences between the datasets, among which F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test [38] .\\nIn order to investigate the hypothesis about a correlation between significant differences (Sig.) of average daily temperatures and average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases in two regions, the following assumptions, and statistical tests have been done:\\n The variances of the two groups are equal: H0  The variances of the two groups are not equal: H1\\n.

Conversely, if the significance level (sig.) is larger than 0.05, the hypothesis H1 is rejected, and the hypothesis H0 is accepted, i.e., the variances of the datasets in the two selected regions are equal.\\nThrough F-test, one determines the presence or absence of differences in the variances of the two regions. Through another statistical test, the Independent-Samples T-Test, one can determine whether the difference is significant, has been used. When using Independent-Samples T-Test, a significance level (sig.) lower (higher) than 0.05, means that the difference is (is not) significant.\\nIn our analysis, we used SPSS software. The critical factors in the SPSS Model set up are as follow:\\n The datasets in different regions of the same countries were analyzed with respect to the average daily air temperature during the 33-day period from 15-Feb to 18-Mar and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the 19 days from 29-Feb to 19-Mar.  In all statistical tests, the confidence level of 95% is considered.  First, the F-test was used to test whether there is a significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies, and then, depending on the F-test result, by the T-Test the existence of a significant difference between the data of the two cases was investigated.\\nThe average daily temperature [39, 40] , and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases [41] , are shown in Figures 2 to 6.\\na. Average daily temperature b. Cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases Correlations between the average temperatures and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases were found especially for towns with significant differences, with respect to the other two towns of the same country, in the average daily temperature. This was the case for Bandar Abas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. The average daily temperature and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases are listed in Table 2 . As a general feature of Table 2 , we notice that  In 11 out of the possible fifteen comparisons, the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is higher when the average daily temperature is lower, and in the four remaining cases the differences in either variable are small.\\nA more specific analysis per country shows that  In Iran, the average daily temperature in Bandar Abbas was the highest (21.54 ºC), and the average cumulative rate of daily of confirmed cases was the lowest (0.000027). .

However, the comparison of Santa Cruz with higher average daily temperatures shows a slower spread of COVID-19.  In the United States, the average daily air temperature in both New York and Seattle are lower than Los Angeles, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases shows the spread of the virus in both is faster than in Los Angeles.\\nThese qualitative results reflect in the statistical analysis of the data by F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test presented in Table 3 .

From the F-test, the F value is equal to 20.4. The criterion for variance equality in the F-test is that the F value must smaller than the critical F value. The statistical analysis has been done on a statistical confidence level of 95%, and therefore the error level is 0.05, and considering the degrees of freedom, the critical F value of the test that can be found through F distribution tables [42] , in this case, is equal to F = 1.57. Since the F value we found is 20.4, larger than the critical F value, the assumption of the equality of variances is rejected. It means that the average temperature variance of the Ramsar and Tehran are not equal.\\nAccording to the t-test, the t value for these two cities is equal to -1.929. Based on an error level of 0.05 and by considering the degrees of freedom, the critical values of the test indicated in the T distribution tables [43] , is in this case equal to t = ± 1.645. Since the t value is out of the critical boundary (-1.645 ≤ acceptable t ≤ +1.645), the assumption of equality in the averages is rejected, and the existence of difference in averages is confirmed. Thus from two tests, it is evident that there is a significant difference between the average temperature of the two cities of Ramsar and Tehran.\\nAn analogous result holds for the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.\\nThe main results of Table 4 , with a confidence level of 95% are as follow:\\n In Iran, the city of Bandar Abbas is significantly different from Ramsar and Tehran in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.  In Italy, the city of Milan is significantly different from Rome and Naples in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases. Instead, the two cities of Rome and Napoli are not significantly different in terms of these variables.  In Germany, there are no significant differences in average daily temperature in all three cities, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different.  In Spain, Barcelona and Valencia are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different. However, in Barcelona and Santa Cruz, the average daily temperature is significantly different, as well as the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, and the same trend exists between Valencia and Santa Cruz.  In the United States, the two cities of New York and Seattle are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and of the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, the number of patients is not significantly different. Instead, the city of Los Angeles is significantly different in terms of average daily temperature with two cities of New York and Seattle, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases are different significantly.\\nThe results of our analysis of daily air temperature for three case studies from five countries showed the existence of correlations between the average temperatures and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when the differences in average daily temperature are larger. For example, in Iran and Italy, the regions with lower average daily temperature had a higher epidemic level of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , and the same trend exists in all other case studies.\\nThe statistical analysis showed that in all the case studies we considered, referring to five different countries, if there is a significant difference in daily mean temperature, there is also a significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, supporting the proposed research hypothesis about the correlation between air temperature and the epidemic rates of COVID-19. Due to the correlations among temperature and hours of sunshine for future research, it is recommended to study the effects of the sun's UV rays as well as the average hours of sunshine on the epidemic rates of COVID-19.\\nThis study analyzed the possible correlation of daily average air temperature with the epidemic rate of the coronavirus (COVID-19) using significant differences analysis between the datasets. The research hypothesis is that in regions with a significant difference in the average daily temperature, the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases would also is different significantly. Conversely, to the absence of a significant difference in daily temperature, would correspond no significant difference in the rate of confirmed cases. The hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately. This comparison using statistical analysis through F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test of the daily temperatures and daily rate of confirmed cases shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.\\n.

       "4  Metagenomic sequencing, which allows us to directly obtain total genomic DNAs from host-associated and environmental samples, has led to important findings in many areas, such as digestive health [1] . While bacteria are the main focus of most metagenomic sequencing projects, there are fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data with sequencing viruses as the main purpose [2] . There are different types of viruses. We are mainly concerned with RNA viruses because many RNA viruses are notorious human pathogens, such as Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, SARS-CoV, and recently identified 2019-nCoV causing Wuhan pneumonia. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. This high genetic diversity within and across different hosts poses a great challenge for designing long-term protection strategies against these infectious diseases. For example, as the circulating strains can change every year, flu vaccine has to be administered every year.\\nAdvances in viral metagenomics have contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. According to a survey by Woolhouse et. al, the number of newly identified RNA viruses is changing from 1,899 in 2005 to 5,561 in 2018, which is 3 times of increase [3] . Largescale RNA virus sequencing projects using nextgeneration sequencing technologies have been conducted for different species. For example, Shi et al. have discovered a large number of new RNA viruses by sequencing samples from invertebrate and vertebrate animals [4, 5] . Claire et al. have discovered 25 new RNA viruses by sequencing samples associated with different drosophilid [6] . Bolduc et al. sequenced RNA viruses from Archaeal and bacterial samples [7] . Given fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data and expected discovery of new viruses, a key step is to conduct composition analysis for these data and assign taxonomic groups for possibly new species.\\nComposition analysis can be conducted at the read level or contig level. There is no doubt that contigs can provide more information than short reads in taxonomic classification. However, metagenomic assembly is still one of the most challenging computational problems in bioinformatics. Unlike single genome assembly, metagenomic assembly is more likely to produce chimeric contigs that can contain regions from different species. Thus, metagenomic assembly is often preceded by read binning that groups reads with the same or similar taxonomic labels [8] in order to achieve better performance.\\nIn this work, we design a read level taxonomic classification tool (named as \"CHEER\") for labeling new species in viral metagenomic data. To detect known species with available reference genomes, alignment-based methods can provide sufficient information for both classification and abundance estimation. This function has been incorporated in existing pipelines [9, 10, 11] and is thus not the focus of our tool. Instead, our tool is designed to handle the challenging cases of assigning taxonomic labels for reads of new species, which have not been observed before. This problem was clearly formulated in metagenomic phylogenetic classification tools such as Phymm and PhymmBL [8] . We first define the classification problem following the formulation in Phymm: the classification problem is the assignment of a phylogenetic group label to each read in input data sets. As we are only interested in the hard case of classifying reads of new species, which have not been sequenced and thus no label exists for these species, the expected labels for these reads are the higher-rank taxonomic groups such as genus, family, or order. All our data and experiments are designed so that the test species are masked in the reference database and the trained models.\\nPrevious experiments have shown that nucleotide-level homology search is not sensitive enough for assigning higher rank taxonomic groups to reads from new species [9, 10] . Protein-based homology search is thus preferred for phylogenetic classification [11, 12] . In particular, a recent tool, VirusSeeker [13] utilized BLASTx to classify reads into bacteria, phages, and other viruses. It is not clear whether the protein homology search is able to generate accurate classification at lower ranks. We will evaluate this in our experiments.\\nThere are also alignment-free methods for phylogenetic classification. Many of those tools implemented different machine learning models and were mainly designed for bacteria. For example, RDP [14] adopted a Naïve Bayes based classifier that can automatically learn features from the reads and assigned taxonomic labels to sequences from bacterial and archaeal 16S genes and fungal 28S genes. The NBC classifier [15, 16] encoded metagenomic reads using k-mers and implemented a bag-of-word model to achieve the readlevel taxonomic classification. Phymm [8] utilized interpolated Markov models (IMMs) for metagenomic read classification. These learning-based models enable users to label reads originating from new species.\\nThe previous works have shown that sequence composition is still an important and informative feature for phylogenetic classification. Recent applications of deep learning models have achieved better performance than conventional machine learning methods in different sequence classification problems [17] . In particular, the convolution filters in Convolutional Neural Network models (CNN) can represent degenerated sequence motifs and thus help CNN models to learn abstract composition-based features. For example, frequently activated convolution filters learned by DeepFam often represented the conserved motifs in different protein domain families [18] . The successful applications of deep learning in sequence classification motivated us to design a novel deep learning-based classification model for assigning taxonomic groups for new species in viral metagenomic data.\\nOur main contributions are summarized below. First, our deep learning model can assign higher rank phylogenetic group labels (such as genus) for reads from new species. To achieve this goal, our model organizes multiple CNN-based classifiers in a tree for hierarchical taxonomic group assignment. Second, to enable our model to capture as much information as possible from short reads, we implemented and compared two encoding methods: one hot vs. embedding. Third, as viral metagenomic data usually contains contaminations from either the host genomes or other microbes, we formulated the pre-processing step as an open set problem in targeted image classification and rejected non-viral reads by choosing appropriate negative training sets. We tested our model on both simulated metagenomic data and also real sequencing data. The results show that our model competes favorably with other popular methods.\\nIn this section, we will introduce our method for viral metagenomic taxonomic classification. First, we will show the architecture of CHEER, which is a hierarchical classification model from order to genus. Second, classifiers at each level will be described. Third, we will introduce DNA sequence encoding using skipgram based word embedding and compare it with onehot encoding. Forth, we will describe the rejection layer, following the idea of the open set problem, which is adopted to filter reads not belonging to RNA viruses. Finally, we will detail our dataset used in training and validation.\\nThe architecture of our model is sketched in Fig. 1. The key component is a tree model that consists of multiple classifiers from order to genus. In order to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species, or even new genus, our classification is conducted using a top-down approach from the root to the leaf node. The top layer is a trained CNN that can reject reads not belonging to RNA viruses, which is an important preprocessing step for viral metagenomic data because of the contamination from the host genome or other microbes. Then, the filtered reads (i.e. mostly RNA viral reads) will be fed into the hierarchical classification model, which is referred to as the tree model hereafter. Specifically, the order-level classifier is responsible for classifying the reads into their originating orders. Then each order has a separately trained classifier for assigning input reads to families within that order (O1 to O3 in Fig. 1 ). For all the reads assigned into one family, the family classifier (F1-F7) will assign the reads to different genus within that family. As an example, a path for classifying a read from a species in genus 7 is highlighted in Fig. 1 . CHEER also implemented early stop functions at each level for stopping the classification path at higher ranks. This function can accommodate taxonomic classification for species from new genus or even higher ranks, which is possible for RNA viruses. It is convenient to add fine-grained classifiers within each genus so that we can assign species-level labels. However, as our focus is to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species that do not have a species labels in the training data, we did not include the species-level assignment in this work.\\nAlternative designs of hierarchical classification work, like [19, 20] , either build a classifier for each taxonomic rank or build a binary classifier for each class. We implemented a structure that built just one classifier for each taxonomic rank and compared different structures' performance. According to the result shown in [Supplementary file 1], the structure shown in Fig.1 is better than one classifier per rank. Although one classifier per rank requires fewer classifiers, it needs to train many more parameters because the number of labels for each classifier increases by times. As a result, we observe overfitting more frequently.\\nEach classifier in the tree model is implemented using CNN, which has achieved superior performance in various sequence classification problems [18] . The convolution filters used in CNN resemble positionspecific weight matrix of motifs in genomic sequences. Frequently activated convolution filters can represent well-conserved motifs among sequences in the same class. Thus, a large number of convolution filters will be used in our CNN in order to learn well-conserved sequence features in different classes. Deep CNNs in fields such as computer vision often have multiple convolution layers in order to obtain more abstract features from training images. Here, we use a wide convolution design rather than a deep one, following the idea in [18] . Fig. 2 shows the classifier with the default hyper-parameters. First, reads will be encoded in matrices as input to the convolution layer using two methods. We will describe and compare these two encoding methods later in the Section 2.3. Then, multiple convolution filters of different sizes are utilized to learn the conserved sequence features. According to our empirical study, we choose 3, 7, 11, 15 as the filter sizes, with 256 filters for each size respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Max pooling is then applied to each convolution filter's output so that only the highest convolution value is kept. After the max-pooling layer, we have a 256-dimentional vector as the output of each convolution layer. We concatenate these four vectors into one 1024-dimentional vector and feed it to one fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting. The CrossEntropyLoss function supplied by Pytorch is adopted as an error estimation function. Due to the unbalanced size of each training class, we use the reciprocal of the proportion of each class as their error weight to help the model fairly learn from each class. And we utilize Adam optimizer with a 0.001 learning rate to update the parameters. The model is trained on HPCC with the 2080Ti GPU unit. \\nIn previous deep learning-based sequence classification models [21, 22] , one hot encoding was commonly adopted to convert a sequence into a matrix, which will then be used as input to convolution layers. There also exist some methods using k-mer composition [23] and frequency [15, 16] to encode the DNA sequence, similar to the bag-of-words model in the field of natural language processing. However, these k-mers representation cannot give complete sequential information about the original reads.\\nTo incorporate both the k-mer composition and also their ordering information, we build a Skip-Gram [24] based embedding layer that can learn which k-mers tend to occur close to each other. Embedding is widely used in natural language processing to learn the semantic and syntactic relationships from sentences. A neural network with one hidden layer is trained to map a word to an n-dimensional vector so that the words that usually occur together will be closer in the n-dimension space. For our DNA read classification task, k-mers are the words and the embedding layer will map proximate kmers into vectors of high similarity. The main hyper-parameter when training the skip-gram model is the size of the training context m, which defines the maximum context location at which the furthest k-mer is taken for training. Specifically, for a kmer at position i as the input to the skip-gram model, the output k-mers are its neighbors located at i+jk, where −m ≤ ≤ m. Larger m results in more training samples with a cost of training time. In our model, the default value of m is 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , we will sample 3 k-mers as our dataset at a time with the middle one as the input and the surrounding two as the output.\\nAs proven in [24] , Skip-Gram is able to automatically learn the relationship between proximate words and thus is expected to help learn the order between k-mers in genomic data. We implemented a hidden layer with 100 hidden units shown in Fig. 3 . After training the model, the co-occurrence features are embedded in the output of the hidden layer. Thus, a k-mer in a read will be represented as a 100-dimension vector, where each element in the vector is the output of the hidden unit in the hidden layer.\\nWhen we use this pre-trained embedding layer to encode the reads, we first split each read into sequential k-mers. Second, each k-mer is fed to the embedding layer and the output is a 100-dimension vector. Third, all these vectors are combined into a large matrix according to the original position of each k-mers. Finally, this matrix will be fed to the convolutional layer.\\nBased on our large-scale experiments, we found that classifiers are easy to overfit with increase of k. Thus, we choose 100-dimensional feature vectors with k being 3 as our default embedding layer parameter set based on our empirical analysis.\\nDue to the small genome size and limitations in library construction, it is not rare that many viral metagenomic datasets are still contaminated with the genomes of the host and other microbes. Viral read screening is thus a key pre-processing step before the downstream composition analysis. Specifically, our tree model should only be applied to viral reads. However, the close set nature of the classifier forces it to assign a known label to each input without being able to distinguish viral reads from others. In this work, we will reject non-viral reads by formulating it as an open set problem in targeted image classification [25] .\\nIn a majority of neural network models [26, 27] , the logit of the last layer will be fed into the SoftMax function, which takes a vector of n real numbers as input and output a normalized probability vector for all labels/classes. However, for an irrelevant input from an unknown clade, all classes in the model tend to have low probabilities and thus applying a threshold on uncertainty can be used to reject unknown classes [25] . Along with this idea, serval approaches [28, 29] have been proposed to solve the open set problem.\\nIn this work, we incorporate the pre-processing step in our hierarchical classification model by integrating a trained CNN and a SoftMax threshold. Contaminations such as bacteria will be rejected using empirically chosen SoftMax threshold τ. Our experiments show that SoftMax outputs a nearly uniform probability distribution of all labels if the input is not relevant. Thus, the SoftMax threshold τ is used to reject reads not belonging to either DNA or RNA viruses. However, using this thresholding method is not able to distinguish DNA viral reads from RNA viral reads due to their similar sequence composition. To accommodate this challenge, we designed a rejection classifier in the top layer using DNA viral reads as the negative class in the training (see Fig. 1 ).\\nAs the focus of our work is to assign labels for new species, the hierarchical classification ends at genuslevel assignment, which is conducted by the bottom layer in Fig. 1 . Given the fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data, there are cases where a new species does not belong to any existing genus and thus the label assignment should stop at the higher ranks. Thus, we allow our model to stop at a higher rank in the tree during the top-down classification. Towards this goal, we still apply SoftMax threshold in our early stop function, which stops reads from further classification by the child classifiers. This early stop function also serves as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications if the confidence is low. For example, when a read arrives, the model may be able to identify its order and family labels with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. In this case, the model should only assign order and family label to this read rather than classifying it into a potentially wrong genus. To achieve this goal, SoftMax threshold is applied for every classifier in the tree. Only reads with a score higher than the threshold will be assigned to the child class.\\nAn example of early stop is highlighted by the yellow path in Fig. 1 . The model can classify the read into order 2 (O2) and then family 4 (F4) with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to.\\nAll the viruses used in the experiments were obtained from the RefSeq in the NCBI virus database. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009001 doi: bioRxiv preprint viruses' taxonomic classification was downloaded from Virus Taxonomy 2018b Release [30] published by the International Committee on Taxonomic of Virus (ICVT). Because training deep learning classifiers required enough samples, we removed the orders with only one family, families with only one genus, and genera with less than 3 species from our dataset. Finally, there are 6 orders, 23 families, and 55 genera remained. The RefSeq genomes are available at the following URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/fi nd-data/virus. The information of the taxa can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. As CHEER conducts read-level taxonomic classification, the training is also conducted using reads. In order to train our model on each complete virus genome, we generated simulated reads by uniformly extracting substrings of 250 bp with 200bp overlaps. All these reads formed the training set so that the model can learn the features from the whole genome. The validation set, however, is generated by read simulation tool WgSim [31] with specified error rate so that we can have a better estimation of the model's performance on real sequencing data. Some existing deep learning tools for taxonomic classification, like [21, 23] , generate reads first, then randomly choose some of them as training set and others as testing set. This strategy cannot guarantee that the training and testing data sets have no overlaps from the same species. In order to test whether our model can learn the label of new species, we use test species masking in the training set. Specifically, we split our RNA virus database into two independent sets. For any test species, their reads are not used in the training data. Thus, the model will only use the knowledge of known species for the new species classification.\\nIn this section, we will first give details of the hyperparameters of CHEER. Then we present the results of applying CHEER to both simulated and mock sequencing data. For the simulated data by WgSim, we evaluated how sequencing error rate affects the performance of CHEER and compared the taxonomic classification results with state-of-the-art. For the mock data, we tested CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and its ability in distinguishing viral reads from others.\\nIn our experiments, the minimum number of species within a genus is 3. We thus constructed three test sets, each containing reads from one species that is randomly chosen from each genus. The three test sets contain three different species, respectively. In total, 165 species from 55 genera are chosen to be \"new\" species for testing and the information of these species can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nWe used WgSim to simulate reads from testing species. In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing error on CHEER, we simulated reads with an error rate of 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively. For each classifier (CNN), we computed the classification accuracy, which is defined in equation (1). To ensure that the computation of the accuracy is not affected by the number of reads from different species, we constructed a balanced test read set by simulating the same number of reads for each test species (1,000 reads for each). (1) For each component classifier in the tree model, we record the average accuracy for multiple test species. For each taxa level, we calculate the average accuracy of all the classifiers in the same level.\\nWe present the results of CHEER at each level in this section. Because CHEER is designed for new species, we benchmark it against alignment-free models. Based on the results shown by Wood et al. [7] , Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) outperformed other alignment-free models. Thus, we compared the performance of CHEER and NBC. NBC in [14] was designed for bacteria taxonomic classification and thus, we retrained NBC on our RNA virus dataset. We implemented the NBC model following [14] with the same parameters. Since each family has a separately trained classifier, which conducts genus classification within that family, there are totally 14 classifiers at this level. Fig. 5 shows the accuracy for labeling families. There are totally 6 classifiers that assign reads to families within each of the 6 orders. Fig. 6 shows the mean accuracy at each rank. The family and genus level accuracy are the average accuracy of all classifiers in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . There is only one classifier for order level classification.\\nAs shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 , CHEER has better performance than NBC across different ranks. We also compared the performance of using one-hot encoding and embedding layer in CHEER. The performance comparison at each rank shows that for most of the classifiers, the embedding layer improves the learning ability. Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 also revealed the robustness of CHEER. Although the classification accuracy decreases as the error rate increases, the decrease is smaller than 2%. The accuracy is almost identical for many classifiers. Thus, CHEER is not very sensitive to sequencing errors. We also conducted experiments for reads with higher error rates (0.02 and 0.05). The results can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nThe next experiment is to evaluate our model on a real sequencing dataset and test CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and non-viral read rejection. We built a mock dataset by mixing Ebolavirus reads with gut bacterial reads from a gut amplicon sequencing dataset, which is chosen to ensure that we only use reads from bacteria. The taxonomic classification of Zaire Ebolavirus in the tree model is highlighted in Fig. 7 . We chose one of the Ebola species named Zaire Ebolavirus as our testing species because it is the most dangerous of the five Ebolavirus species and was responsible for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We downloaded the dataset from NCBI with accession number SRR1930021. These reads were sequenced by Illumina using whole-genome amplification strategy. Since Zaire Ebolavirus usually causes fatal hemorrhagic fever and abdominal pain, it is possible that this Ebola virus occurs with other gut bacteria. Thus, we created a mock viral metagenomic data by mixing these Ebola reads with a gut bacteria amplicon sequencing data in order to test whether CHEER can reject the bacterial reads at the top rejection layer. The gut bacteria dataset is downloaded from NCBI with accession number: SRR10714026. There are totally 2,737 Ebola virus reads and 51,280 gut bacterial reads in the mock data. After the rejection layer, the Ebola reads will be used to evaluate our tree model.\\nTo treat Zaire Ebolavirus as a \"new\" species, we removed its genome from our training set and re-trained the whole pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7 , after removing this species, we still have four Ebola species in our training set. However, our read mapping experiment using Bowtie2 [32] showed that none of the reads from Zaire Ebolavirus can be mapped to other Ebola species with the default parameters, indicating that using usual alignment-based methods will have difficulty to conduct genus-level assignment.\\nIn our work, CHEER will first use rejection layer to remove the reads not belonging to the RNA virus. Second, the \"Order classifier\" will be applied to evaluate how many reads can be classified into Mononegavirales order. Third, \"Mononegavirales classifier\" takes all these Mononegavirales reads as input to predict how many reads will be assigned to the Filoviridae family. Finally, \"Filoviridae classifier\" is adopted to check how many reads belong to the Ebola genus. Fig. 8 show the ROC curve of the rejection layer. True positive rate reveals how many Ebolavirus reads pass the rejection layer. The false positive rate reveals how many gut bacterial reads pass the rejection layer. We generated thresholds from 0 to 1 with step size 0.01 and used each threshold for the rejection layer. Then for each threshold, we recorded the true positive rate and false positive rate for plotting the ROC curve. As shown in Fig. 8 , with the increase of the threshold, more bacterial reads are filtered by the rejection layer, at the expense of missing more real Ebola reads. The default threshold for the rejection layer is 0.6 in CHEER. User can adjust the threshold according to their needs.\\nAfter evaluating the rejection layer, we continued to test the hierarchical classification performance at each rank. We first compared our tree model with NBC. Then we also benchmarked CHEER with the method using protein-level alignment in Section 3.3.3. The performance of the complete hierarchical classification pipeline of NBC and CHEER is shown in Fig. 9 . From order to genus, each bar shows the accuracy of correctly classified reads by the parent classifier. For example, NBC correctly classified 1580 at the order level. Then, 1564 out of the 1580 reads are correctly labeled at the family level. While Fig. 4 , 5, and 6 have shown the performance of CHEER and NBC at each taxonomic rank using the same set of reads as input for each level of classifiers, this experiment focused on comparing the hierarchical classification pipeline using only correctly predicted reads by the parent classifier. The results demonstrated that CHEER can classify Ebola reads with better performance. NBC can only classify 1,564 (57.1%) reads into Ebolavirus. CHEER, however, had totally 2407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly.\\nAlthough nucleotide-level alignment models are not ideal choices for predicting new species, as mentioned in [8] , protein-level alignment such as BLASTx is still frequently used for homology search because of the conservation among homologous protein sequences. We followed VirusSeeker [10] , which is a BLASTx based model, to align translated reads to virus-only protein database (VIRUSDB NR) provided by NCBI. Then, we kept alignments with E-value cutoff 0.001, which is used in VirusSeeker. The output of BLASTx shows that a read can often align to multiple proteins, making the phylogenetic classification ambiguous (see Fig. 11 ). Also, existing tools such as VirusSeeker often use the best alignment only, which does not always yield the highest accuracy. To optimize the usage of the alignment-based method, we implemented k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm to record the best k alignments rather than only using the best one. The label of the input read is determined by the majority vote in the labels of the top k alignments. According to Fig. 10 , most of the reads have hit numbers between 11 to 15 and 6 to10. Thus, we chose 1, 5, 10, 15 as our k when running kNN. There are also 512 reads that cannot be aligned with any VIRUSDB protein sequence. All these reads will be regarded as wrong prediction. Fig. 11 shows the classification results of kNN. When we use the best hit as the prediction the accuracy is only 64%. The best performance of kNN will be 74% with 2,026 correct predictions when k is 5. But the accuracy sharply decreases if k is larger than 5. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 also revealed that it is hard for users to choose a proper k in real classification tasks. The most common value of the hit number is 11-15 shown in Fig. 11 . The best kNN result, however, has a k equal to 5. Thus, comparing to this alignment-based method, CHEER, with 2,407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly, is more practical and reliable.\\nThe two main purposes of the early stop function are: 1) to handle the cases of a new species from an unseen genus or higher ranks; 2) to serve as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications in child classifiers. As Fig. 6 shows, the higher rank classification tends to be more accurate than lower ranks. Because the genus of Ebolavirus exists in our classification tree, the evaluation of the early stop function focuses on the second purpose. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of how many reads are classified into Ebolavirus genus correctly for different classifiers. By allowing early stop, the number of wrong predictions decreased sharply. In short, although there are fewer reads being labelled at the genus level, the total number of reads with wrong classification is decreased. Thus, this is still a useful feature provided by CHEER.\\nAnother significant advantage of CHEER is the high classification speed. Although training the model uses heavy computing resources, the inference procedure of this algorithm is fast. And with the help of GPU acceleration, the training time also decreases a lot.\\nIn the experiments shown in Section 3.4, it takes around 46 minutes to run BLASTx against the virus protein database. Our method, however, only takes 7 second for the preprocessing step to convert the raw sequence into a vector, and then takes less than 35 second to make the prediction for all 2,737 reads.\\nIn this work, all training data are RNA virus genomes downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq database. The training reads are extracted uniformly from the genome to make sure that classifiers can learn the features from the whole genome. To evaluate the model on new species detection, all species in the test set are excluded from the training data. Error rates are also added to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results reveal that the model is tolerant to the sequencing error. In addition, a SoftMax threshold rejection layer is applied to filter reads from non-RNA viruses. The SoftMax threshold in each classifier will also help early stop classification with low confidence and thus decreases the wrong predication rate. We show a case study on real-world data to identify how this threshold will influence the rejection classifier and early stop function. The results show that CHEER competes favorably with state-of-the-art tools.\\n   \n",
