       "      <td>An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently renamed CoVID-19, was first reported from Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. During January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, and the first cases started appearing outside China. By the end of January 2020, 9,720 cases had been confirmed in China, with 106 confirmed cases outside China across 19 different countries (1) .\\nEpidemiological analysis of the outbreak was quickly used to start estimating epidemiologicallyrelevant parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the serial interval, the incubation period and the case fatality rate (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Initial estimates suggested that the reproduction number was between 2 and 3 and the case fatality rate was less than 4% (8) . Control of spread by contact tracing and isolation appears to be challenging, given what is currently known about the virus (9) .\\nMathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the possible course of an outbreak, given a set of underlying assumptions. Here, we adapt a metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales to capture the spread of CoVID-19 (10) . The aim is to provide predictions about the likely timing of the peak of the epidemic in England and Wales and spatial features of spread.\\nWe use an existing national-scale stochastic metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales. The model structure is based on the metapopulation model described in detail in Danon et al (2009) (10) . In this model, the population is divided into electoral wards. Because of the changes in data availability, we restricted the model to England and Wales, whereas the original model covered Great Britain.\\nTransmission between wards occurs via the daily movement of individuals. For each ward, we assume that individuals contribute to the force of infection in their \"home\" ward during the night and their \"work\" ward during the day. See Danon et al 2009 for further details (10) .\\nData for population and movement of individuals come from the 2011 census of the United Kingdom. The population size of each of the 8,570 electoral wards is available directly from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) website. The number of individuals moving between locations is also available from the ONS website, but at the level of census output areas (OAs). We aggregated the data from OA level to electoral wards level. Spatial location of electoral ward centres are extracted from maps available from the ONS websites.\\nWe use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Infectious-Recovered (SEIIR) model within each ward to capture the progression of disease within an individual (figure 1). Initial analyses used SARS-like parameters for the incubation period and infectious period, which now appear to differ from CoVID-19(4). Li et al (2020) analysed data on 425 cases reported in Wuhan in China and fitted a log-normal distribution to the incubation period, and a gamma distribution for the serial interval (2) . The infectious period for SARS was estimated as the serial interval minus the .

We used two infectious states to represent a mildly symptomatic or prodromal period and a period with more pronounced symptoms. In the absence of data on the relative magnitude of these two infections states, we assumed the same length of time in each infectious state and assumed that each state was equally infectious. We sampled from each of the distributions 100 times independently (Table 1 ). \\nThe census data are used to initialise the population sizes within each of the 8,570 wards. At the start of the model, all individuals are assumed to be susceptible to infection with no 3 e .

We investigated a range of starting scenarios by seeding the infection in example wards London, Birmingham, Brighton, Sheffield and Cardiff. To seed infection in a ward, we move five individuals (non-commuters) from the susceptible compartment to the first infectious state.\\nWe investigated the impact of a seasonally affected transmission rate, to capture potential decreased transmission during the summer months. We captured seasonal transmission by replacing the constant transmission rate with a time-varying transmission rate given by:\\nis the magnitude of the seasonal difference in transmission, ranging from\\n(maximum seasonality with no transmission at the peak of the summer).\\nFrom the model, we extracted the total number of infections per day, as the number of individuals in both of the Infectious states, and the number of infected wards per day as the total number of wards with at least one individual in one of the two Infectious states. The spatial growth of the epidemic in England and Wales was visualised using interactive maps. We estimated the timing of the epidemic peak from the aggregated epidemic curve and calculated 95% prediction intervals from the model simulations.\\nThe model is coded in C and is available on github (http://github.com/ldanon/MetaWards). The data are freely available from the Office for National Statistics website, or can be downloaded with the code at the github repository.\\nWe predict that, in the absence of any interventions, a disease with \"best-guess\" CoVID-19-like parameters will peak a median of 133 days (range 126 -147 days) following the start of personto-person transmission in England and Wales. Intrinsic model stochasticity is responsible for variation between model runs. Using exactly the same parameters and seeding the infection in the same initial wards resulted in a difference in peak timing of +/-10 days (figure 2). The attack rate for best-guess parameters had a median of 45799874 (81.67% range 81.64-81.69), with a peak incidence median 1,116,692.\\n.

Epidemics seeded in Brighton, London, Birmingham and Sheffield resulted in synchronised epidemics in England, reaching urban areas first followed by rural areas. Epidemics started in Cardiff had a slower time to peak but still resulted in a generalised outbreak.\\nSpatially, some disaggregation between England and Wales regions is observed. An outbreak starting in Brighton, (South East England) peaks in London and the South East first, and North East England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales last, with a ten-day lag between regions ( Figure 3 ).\\nModel predictions are highly sensitive to parameter values and incorporating parameter uncertainty increases the variability of model predictions. In the absence of any control measures, all predictions resulted in epidemics that peaked within a year from the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales. Estimates of peak time ranged from 78 days to 241 days (Figure 4 ).\\n.

Assuming no difference in transmission rate during the year leads to a single large epidemic after approximately 4 months (June time if transmission starts in February), as above. With a 25% reduction in transmission the epidemic is smaller and peaks later, reducing the overall attack rate by 20%. A 50% reduction in transmission results in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. The attack rate is 10% less than a non-seasonal epidemic. A 75% reduction in transmission over the summer resulted in a delayed large outbreak, but with a similar attack rate. If transmission decreases to zero over the summer then the resulting outbreak is much reduced, with an attack rate of less than 1% ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ). .

Our findings suggest that the height of the epidemic and the attack rate is highly dependent on seasonality of transmission and that even small changes in transmission risk can lead to large changes in attack rate due to the spatial disaggregation of the population at risk.\\nA combination of control measures and seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the peak of the outbreak to the winter of 2020/21, with little effect on the final attack rate. If contact tracing and isolation efforts succeed in reducing transmission, but are unable to control the epidemic (9), an additional influx of severe CoVID-19 cases may exacerbate existing challenges with winter healthcare demand. A careful analysis of the impact of control measures on the timing of incidence of severe cases is warranted.\\nThe strength of this model lies in the spatial heterogeneity which tempers transmission. As a comparison, an equivalent non-spatial model results in the epidemic peaking after 34 days, nearly four times faster than this spatial model, and would be unable to capture the interaction between spatial transmission and seasonality. The estimated total number of people infected in the spatial model is marginally smaller than for a non-spatial model, as the infection has the opportunity to die-out in local parts of the country. As the model framework was developed and published in 2009, it was possible to re-deploy the model for these new circumstances; developing such a model from scratch during an outbreak would be a significant challenge.\\nA key element missing from our model is morbidity, mortality and the treatment of cases. The model in its current form predicts the total number of infections in the community rather than diagnosed cases. Observations from China suggest that many cases have mild symptoms and that only around 5% of cases have been reported and diagnosed (3) . The parameter estimates we used from China appear to be substantially different to previous coronaviruses (6) . Should CoVID-19 continue spreading the UK it will become possible to get UK-specific parameter estimates and improve prediction accuracy.\\nAs with all modelling, it is impossible to capture the full complexity of an epidemic. In this model, the major assumptions are that we have assumed that there is no change in behaviour during the course of the epidemic. In practice, as the epidemic starts spreading in England and Wales there may well be a systematic change in behaviour as was seen during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. We have not included any age-effects, such as differential mixing, susceptibility or infectiousness. That means that we are not able to investigate the impact of school closures or the impact of the summer holidays, which had a large impact on the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009.\\n</td>\n",

       "21  An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently renamed CoVID-19, was first reported from Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. During January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, and the first cases started appearing outside China. By the end of January 2020, 9,720 cases had been confirmed in China, with 106 confirmed cases outside China across 19 different countries (1) .\\nEpidemiological analysis of the outbreak was quickly used to start estimating epidemiologicallyrelevant parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the serial interval, the incubation period and the case fatality rate (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Initial estimates suggested that the reproduction number was between 2 and 3 and the case fatality rate was less than 4% (8) . Control of spread by contact tracing and isolation appears to be challenging, given what is currently known about the virus (9) .\\nMathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the possible course of an outbreak, given a set of underlying assumptions. Here, we adapt a metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales to capture the spread of CoVID-19 (10) . The aim is to provide predictions about the likely timing of the peak of the epidemic in England and Wales and spatial features of spread.\\nWe use an existing national-scale stochastic metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales. The model structure is based on the metapopulation model described in detail in Danon et al (2009) (10) . In this model, the population is divided into electoral wards. Because of the changes in data availability, we restricted the model to England and Wales, whereas the original model covered Great Britain.\\nTransmission between wards occurs via the daily movement of individuals. For each ward, we assume that individuals contribute to the force of infection in their \"home\" ward during the night and their \"work\" ward during the day. See Danon et al 2009 for further details (10) .\\nData for population and movement of individuals come from the 2011 census of the United Kingdom. The population size of each of the 8,570 electoral wards is available directly from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) website. The number of individuals moving between locations is also available from the ONS website, but at the level of census output areas (OAs). We aggregated the data from OA level to electoral wards level. Spatial location of electoral ward centres are extracted from maps available from the ONS websites.\\nWe use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Infectious-Recovered (SEIIR) model within each ward to capture the progression of disease within an individual (figure 1). Initial analyses used SARS-like parameters for the incubation period and infectious period, which now appear to differ from CoVID-19(4). Li et al (2020) analysed data on 425 cases reported in Wuhan in China and fitted a log-normal distribution to the incubation period, and a gamma distribution for the serial interval (2) . The infectious period for SARS was estimated as the serial interval minus the .

We used two infectious states to represent a mildly symptomatic or prodromal period and a period with more pronounced symptoms. In the absence of data on the relative magnitude of these two infections states, we assumed the same length of time in each infectious state and assumed that each state was equally infectious. We sampled from each of the distributions 100 times independently (Table 1 ). \\nThe census data are used to initialise the population sizes within each of the 8,570 wards. At the start of the model, all individuals are assumed to be susceptible to infection with no 3 e .

We investigated a range of starting scenarios by seeding the infection in example wards London, Birmingham, Brighton, Sheffield and Cardiff. To seed infection in a ward, we move five individuals (non-commuters) from the susceptible compartment to the first infectious state.\\nWe investigated the impact of a seasonally affected transmission rate, to capture potential decreased transmission during the summer months. We captured seasonal transmission by replacing the constant transmission rate with a time-varying transmission rate given by:\\nis the magnitude of the seasonal difference in transmission, ranging from\\n(maximum seasonality with no transmission at the peak of the summer).\\nFrom the model, we extracted the total number of infections per day, as the number of individuals in both of the Infectious states, and the number of infected wards per day as the total number of wards with at least one individual in one of the two Infectious states. The spatial growth of the epidemic in England and Wales was visualised using interactive maps. We estimated the timing of the epidemic peak from the aggregated epidemic curve and calculated 95% prediction intervals from the model simulations.\\nThe model is coded in C and is available on github (http://github.com/ldanon/MetaWards). The data are freely available from the Office for National Statistics website, or can be downloaded with the code at the github repository.\\nWe predict that, in the absence of any interventions, a disease with \"best-guess\" CoVID-19-like parameters will peak a median of 133 days (range 126 -147 days) following the start of personto-person transmission in England and Wales. Intrinsic model stochasticity is responsible for variation between model runs. Using exactly the same parameters and seeding the infection in the same initial wards resulted in a difference in peak timing of +/-10 days (figure 2). The attack rate for best-guess parameters had a median of 45799874 (81.67% range 81.64-81.69), with a peak incidence median 1,116,692.\\n.

Epidemics seeded in Brighton, London, Birmingham and Sheffield resulted in synchronised epidemics in England, reaching urban areas first followed by rural areas. Epidemics started in Cardiff had a slower time to peak but still resulted in a generalised outbreak.\\nSpatially, some disaggregation between England and Wales regions is observed. An outbreak starting in Brighton, (South East England) peaks in London and the South East first, and North East England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales last, with a ten-day lag between regions ( Figure 3 ).\\nModel predictions are highly sensitive to parameter values and incorporating parameter uncertainty increases the variability of model predictions. In the absence of any control measures, all predictions resulted in epidemics that peaked within a year from the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales. Estimates of peak time ranged from 78 days to 241 days (Figure 4 ).\\n.

Assuming no difference in transmission rate during the year leads to a single large epidemic after approximately 4 months (June time if transmission starts in February), as above. With a 25% reduction in transmission the epidemic is smaller and peaks later, reducing the overall attack rate by 20%. A 50% reduction in transmission results in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. The attack rate is 10% less than a non-seasonal epidemic. A 75% reduction in transmission over the summer resulted in a delayed large outbreak, but with a similar attack rate. If transmission decreases to zero over the summer then the resulting outbreak is much reduced, with an attack rate of less than 1% ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ). .

Our findings suggest that the height of the epidemic and the attack rate is highly dependent on seasonality of transmission and that even small changes in transmission risk can lead to large changes in attack rate due to the spatial disaggregation of the population at risk.\\nA combination of control measures and seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the peak of the outbreak to the winter of 2020/21, with little effect on the final attack rate. If contact tracing and isolation efforts succeed in reducing transmission, but are unable to control the epidemic (9), an additional influx of severe CoVID-19 cases may exacerbate existing challenges with winter healthcare demand. A careful analysis of the impact of control measures on the timing of incidence of severe cases is warranted.\\nThe strength of this model lies in the spatial heterogeneity which tempers transmission. As a comparison, an equivalent non-spatial model results in the epidemic peaking after 34 days, nearly four times faster than this spatial model, and would be unable to capture the interaction between spatial transmission and seasonality. The estimated total number of people infected in the spatial model is marginally smaller than for a non-spatial model, as the infection has the opportunity to die-out in local parts of the country. As the model framework was developed and published in 2009, it was possible to re-deploy the model for these new circumstances; developing such a model from scratch during an outbreak would be a significant challenge.\\nA key element missing from our model is morbidity, mortality and the treatment of cases. The model in its current form predicts the total number of infections in the community rather than diagnosed cases. Observations from China suggest that many cases have mild symptoms and that only around 5% of cases have been reported and diagnosed (3) . The parameter estimates we used from China appear to be substantially different to previous coronaviruses (6) . Should CoVID-19 continue spreading the UK it will become possible to get UK-specific parameter estimates and improve prediction accuracy.\\nAs with all modelling, it is impossible to capture the full complexity of an epidemic. In this model, the major assumptions are that we have assumed that there is no change in behaviour during the course of the epidemic. In practice, as the epidemic starts spreading in England and Wales there may well be a systematic change in behaviour as was seen during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. We have not included any age-effects, such as differential mixing, susceptibility or infectiousness. That means that we are not able to investigate the impact of school closures or the impact of the summer holidays, which had a large impact on the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009.\\n  "

       "      <td>Changes to local land use and biodiversity, the increasing international connectivity through human transport and trade and climate change provide optimal conditions for the emergence of refers to a potential international epidemic caused by a currently unknown pathogen, for which WHO calls for preparedness in the event of a novel disease emergence. This list of diseases in need of urgent research was termed as Blueprint list of Priority Diseases (BPDs).\\nAll the BPDs in the current list can be classified as zoonotic viral infections. In the past four decades, over 70% of the emerging infections are or were zoonoses (3, 4) . The increasing unpredictability in the global climate and the decreasing distance between the local humananimal-ecosystem interactions play a major role in driving the emergence of infection in human populations. The rising mean temperatures have been reported to have a significant effect in the tick-borne CCHF incidence and mosquito-borne Zika sustainability in subtropical and temperate .

Bushmeat consumption and animal trading, arising from the growing demand of animal protein, causes significant changes at the human-animal reservoir interface (7). Among the BPDs, studies demonstrate that the SARS and EVD outbreaks were directly linked to the consumption of infected bushmeat (8, 9) . LF, MVD and EVD flourish in West and central Africa where the consumption of bushmeat is four times greater than the Amazon, which is richer in biodiversity (10) . Moreover, EIDs are also triggered by anthropogenic pressures on land use for agricultural expansion and livestock farming to meet the demand of a growing human population. The fruit-bat migration driven by the deforestation through forest fires in the islands of Sumatra lead to the emergence of Nipah disease in farmers and abattoir workers in Malaysia (11, 12) . Once sufficient infection cycles between human-animal without the sustainable transmission among humans termed as viral chatter is established, the emergence of human-tohuman transmission is inevitable (7). Mathematical modeling and prediction provides quick assessment for control and potential preventive efforts when time for epidemiological studies is scarce (13) . Modeling of infection dynamics analyses diseases outbreaks in animal population and estimates the rate of transmission as well as the potential chance of spillover. Yet, the increasing trends of EIDs risks surpass our capacity in the surveillance and detection of spillovers and outbreaks. Thus, the current public health response to EIDs is to \"get ahead of the curve\" and the growing resolution of satellite imagery has shifted the paradigm towards identifying potential environmental drivers such as deforestation, land fragmentation, biodiversity loss and climate change rather than the surveillance of the EIDs themselves.\\nHere we proposed mapping the predictive risk of the BPDs using Species Distribution Models (SDM) based on potential environmental drivers such as deforestation, landscape and climatic covariates derived from satellite imagery following the year 2000. The aim is to provide a global .

We also used our approach to EIDs using disease biogeography as a tool to identify the potential hotspots for an unknown Disease X listed in the BPDs.\\nTo construct robust models and generate predictive risk data of the BPDs' distribution, we adapted the following steps from species distribution modelling: 1) compilation of the geographical coordinates of the BPDs emergence; 2) construction of spatial buffer around the spatial points; 3) generation of pseudo absence points; 4) extraction of environmental predictor covariates; 5) fitting of the model and 6) calculation of the predictive risk of each BPD.\\nWe extracted the distributional data on the global occurrence of the BPDs in humans across the years 2000 to 2019 from WHO archives, Promed mail and published studies (Appendix Table. 1).\\nIn cases where the origin of the BPDs were unclear, we narrow down to the general region or district of origin. In other words, the localization of BPDs emergence correspond to patient zero of each outbreak. We did not include the diseases endemic to countries such as CCHF and Lassa fever. The calculation of predictive risk for endemic diseases and pandemics such as Zika may not contribute to the existing evidence. Laboratory outbreaks and outbreak in domestic and wildlife were also excluded. We georeferenced the sites of origin or the centroids of the region of occurrence to the nearest 0.0001°. Spatial buffers were constructed around the geographical coordinates depending upon the mobility range of the respective pathogens reservoirs and intermediate buffers (Appendix table 2 ). The construction of buffers also mitigates the relatively .

For the presence points, we generated 100 random points at a 100km spatial buffer around the point of origin of each BPDs outbreak. Then, a spatial bufferzone of 150km was used as a mask and we generated 1000 pseudo-absence points within the geographical extent of the reservoirs of each of the BPDs. We chose the buffer of radius 150km to account to the average flying range of the order Chiroptera, the reservoirs of most BPD.\\nWe extracted the climatic covariates such as monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation from 'Terra Climate' high-resolution global data from 2000-2017 (14) . Land cover data used was a composite of the 2017 MODIS satellite imagery and the deforestations mdata was derived from the Hansan's deforestation tree loss-year maps from 2000-2018. The topological data including altitude and hydrological models was extracted from one arc-second digital elevation model (DEM) of 30m resolution, derived from NASA Version 3.0 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) imagery available in the United States Geological Survey (USGS). We obtained the geographical distribution of the primary hosts and reservoir mammals from the IUCN red list (15) . The shapefiles were rasterized and resampled into rasters of the 5km resolution raster model. We used livestock distribution rasters (2010) from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) for diseases such as RVF and Nipah including cattle, goats and .

The raster layers were resampled to a fixed resolution of 5km and stacked to a raster brick.\\nThe disease distribution models were fitted using the r package \"discmo\". In our study, we used the main two methods for species distribution modelling (SDM) i) the classical generalized linear models (glm) using gaussian regression methods and ii) the machine learning method, support vector machine (SVM). We choose the glm models to analyze the influence of the environmental factors on the emergence of BPDs. SVM are popular in SDM using presence and pseudo-absence data. The models were evaluated using ROC curves and the area under curves (AUC) for the produced thresholds were calculated. Studies have critized the use of AUCs in the evaluation of SDMs, especially when the study involves large extent. We removed the \"spatial sorting bias\" through \"point-wise distance sampling\" as explained by Hijmanns, 2012. Model prediction was made using the \"predict\" function to map the predictive risk of the diseases based on the values of the independent variables extracted from the environmental predictor rasters. A weighed average of the glm and SVM models were calculated using the AUCs for each BPD model and a final composite prediction was made.\\nTo analyze the impact of deforestation on the emergence of the BPDs, we conducted a detailed spatiotemporal analysis using the R package \"gfcanalytics\" on the Hansan's tree cover loss maps. We used the presence points at a spatial buffer of 100km, used for the BPD models, for this analysis.\\n.

We used glm and SVM methods of SDM for each of the disease. The AUC was maintained at an average of 0.9323 for glm models and 0.9597 for the SVM models. We have tabulated the AUC for each model in Table 1 .\\nThe distribution of the filovirus diseases, EVD and MVD, was restricted to the African subcontinent (Figures 1 &amp; 2 \\nThe weighed means of the AUC from the BPD models were used to create a threshold and the potential hotspots for the emergence of disease X was mapped ( Figure 6 ).\\nOur study was the first to map the predictive risk of the disease emergence using species distribution models and to establish the impact of environmental factors on their emergence.

The results of our study have shown that the disease emergence is spatially dependent on the bioclimatic factors such as elevation, tree cover loss and climatic covariates. These factors could thus be utilized to identify and predict the hotspots of Disease X.\\nWe found elevation to have a significant influence on the distribution of Nipah and coronavirus diseases. Studies have hypothesized that Nipah emergence in lower Gangetic plains and at the low-lying backwaters could be attributed to flooding, which causes destruction of mammal habitats (17) . Rapid changes to habitats lead to starvation and migration of the known reservoirs of the Nipah virus, the bats, with contamination of fruit trees near human dwelling and increased exposure to the pathogen. Our results confirm this hypothesis associated with low-lying plains, flooding and emergence of Nipah disease. Coronaviruses are also linked with bat reservoirs. We hypothesize that similar events leading to destruction of bat habitats due to flooding at the lowlying regions such the wadis near Jeddah and Zhujiang Basin at the Province of Guangdong triggered the emergence of MERS and SARS respectively.\\nA recent study found that the increase in surface temperature and the unpredictability in the seasonal rainfall due to climate change, has an indirect effect on disease emergence through the sudden changes to the reservoirs habitats, biodiversity loss and small mammal migration (18) .\\nOur results demonstrate that increase in the residual temperature also known as the minimum temperature has a direct influence on the emergence and distribution of the BPDs. This direct spatial dependence of disease emergence on minimum temperatures is worrying. With climate change, the increasing night minimum temperatures lengthens the freeze-free season in most mid-and high latitude regions (19) . These conditions with worsening climate change could .

This hypothesis has been established from the vector-borne BPDs emergence predictions like CCHF and Zika (5, 20) .\\nOur study observed that deforestation is another important factor driving the emergence of BPDs. Studies have established the impact of deforestation and migration of bats on the occurrence of EVD, Nipah and SARS diseases (11, 21, 22) . Most of the models showed tree cover loss at 100km around the occurrence of the BPDs (see for example EVD, Figure 7 ). Biodiversity loss, due to anthropogenic changes to their habitat such as deforestation, land fragmentation for agriculture, increase in demand for protein and climate We hypothesize that a decrease in predators could cause an imbalance in the natural predator-prey equilibrium leading to an increase in small mammal reservoirs and thus to viruses transmission via disease vectors such as ticks. Lesser species diversity and inter-species interactions makes spillover easier towards the accidental human hosts. This has been termed as the \"dilution effect\" (23).\\nAs with all mathematical models, our study has its limitations. The size of the environmental predictor raster layers limited our spatial extent of the models. We chose the quality of the satellite imagery and resolution over a global perspective with poor or outdated data. Our study does not have a temporal component in the form of times series, which would be interesting especially with the climatic covariates. We mitigated this by choosing recent raster data corresponding to the period of the study and linking the spatiotemporal presence and pseudoabsence points to corresponding climatic monthly covariates. Despite these limitations, our study is the first to confirm the validity and effectiveness of using SDMs and other mathematical models to predict and identify the potential hotspots for BPDs. The use of a biogeographic approach in disease modelling offers a wider perspective on the environmental drivers and highlights the importance of climate change in the context of disease emergence.

       "183  Changes to local land use and biodiversity, the increasing international connectivity through human transport and trade and climate change provide optimal conditions for the emergence of refers to a potential international epidemic caused by a currently unknown pathogen, for which WHO calls for preparedness in the event of a novel disease emergence. This list of diseases in need of urgent research was termed as Blueprint list of Priority Diseases (BPDs).\\nAll the BPDs in the current list can be classified as zoonotic viral infections. In the past four decades, over 70% of the emerging infections are or were zoonoses (3, 4) . The increasing unpredictability in the global climate and the decreasing distance between the local humananimal-ecosystem interactions play a major role in driving the emergence of infection in human populations. The rising mean temperatures have been reported to have a significant effect in the tick-borne CCHF incidence and mosquito-borne Zika sustainability in subtropical and temperate .

Bushmeat consumption and animal trading, arising from the growing demand of animal protein, causes significant changes at the human-animal reservoir interface (7). Among the BPDs, studies demonstrate that the SARS and EVD outbreaks were directly linked to the consumption of infected bushmeat (8, 9) . LF, MVD and EVD flourish in West and central Africa where the consumption of bushmeat is four times greater than the Amazon, which is richer in biodiversity (10) . Moreover, EIDs are also triggered by anthropogenic pressures on land use for agricultural expansion and livestock farming to meet the demand of a growing human population. The fruit-bat migration driven by the deforestation through forest fires in the islands of Sumatra lead to the emergence of Nipah disease in farmers and abattoir workers in Malaysia (11, 12) . Once sufficient infection cycles between human-animal without the sustainable transmission among humans termed as viral chatter is established, the emergence of human-tohuman transmission is inevitable (7). Mathematical modeling and prediction provides quick assessment for control and potential preventive efforts when time for epidemiological studies is scarce (13) . Modeling of infection dynamics analyses diseases outbreaks in animal population and estimates the rate of transmission as well as the potential chance of spillover. Yet, the increasing trends of EIDs risks surpass our capacity in the surveillance and detection of spillovers and outbreaks. Thus, the current public health response to EIDs is to \"get ahead of the curve\" and the growing resolution of satellite imagery has shifted the paradigm towards identifying potential environmental drivers such as deforestation, land fragmentation, biodiversity loss and climate change rather than the surveillance of the EIDs themselves.\\nHere we proposed mapping the predictive risk of the BPDs using Species Distribution Models (SDM) based on potential environmental drivers such as deforestation, landscape and climatic covariates derived from satellite imagery following the year 2000. The aim is to provide a global .

We also used our approach to EIDs using disease biogeography as a tool to identify the potential hotspots for an unknown Disease X listed in the BPDs.\\nTo construct robust models and generate predictive risk data of the BPDs' distribution, we adapted the following steps from species distribution modelling: 1) compilation of the geographical coordinates of the BPDs emergence; 2) construction of spatial buffer around the spatial points; 3) generation of pseudo absence points; 4) extraction of environmental predictor covariates; 5) fitting of the model and 6) calculation of the predictive risk of each BPD.\\nWe extracted the distributional data on the global occurrence of the BPDs in humans across the years 2000 to 2019 from WHO archives, Promed mail and published studies (Appendix Table. 1).\\nIn cases where the origin of the BPDs were unclear, we narrow down to the general region or district of origin. In other words, the localization of BPDs emergence correspond to patient zero of each outbreak. We did not include the diseases endemic to countries such as CCHF and Lassa fever. The calculation of predictive risk for endemic diseases and pandemics such as Zika may not contribute to the existing evidence. Laboratory outbreaks and outbreak in domestic and wildlife were also excluded. We georeferenced the sites of origin or the centroids of the region of occurrence to the nearest 0.0001°. Spatial buffers were constructed around the geographical coordinates depending upon the mobility range of the respective pathogens reservoirs and intermediate buffers (Appendix table 2 ). The construction of buffers also mitigates the relatively .

For the presence points, we generated 100 random points at a 100km spatial buffer around the point of origin of each BPDs outbreak. Then, a spatial bufferzone of 150km was used as a mask and we generated 1000 pseudo-absence points within the geographical extent of the reservoirs of each of the BPDs. We chose the buffer of radius 150km to account to the average flying range of the order Chiroptera, the reservoirs of most BPD.\\nWe extracted the climatic covariates such as monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation from 'Terra Climate' high-resolution global data from 2000-2017 (14) . Land cover data used was a composite of the 2017 MODIS satellite imagery and the deforestations mdata was derived from the Hansan's deforestation tree loss-year maps from 2000-2018. The topological data including altitude and hydrological models was extracted from one arc-second digital elevation model (DEM) of 30m resolution, derived from NASA Version 3.0 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) imagery available in the United States Geological Survey (USGS). We obtained the geographical distribution of the primary hosts and reservoir mammals from the IUCN red list (15) . The shapefiles were rasterized and resampled into rasters of the 5km resolution raster model. We used livestock distribution rasters (2010) from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) for diseases such as RVF and Nipah including cattle, goats and .

The raster layers were resampled to a fixed resolution of 5km and stacked to a raster brick.\\nThe disease distribution models were fitted using the r package \"discmo\". In our study, we used the main two methods for species distribution modelling (SDM) i) the classical generalized linear models (glm) using gaussian regression methods and ii) the machine learning method, support vector machine (SVM). We choose the glm models to analyze the influence of the environmental factors on the emergence of BPDs. SVM are popular in SDM using presence and pseudo-absence data. The models were evaluated using ROC curves and the area under curves (AUC) for the produced thresholds were calculated. Studies have critized the use of AUCs in the evaluation of SDMs, especially when the study involves large extent. We removed the \"spatial sorting bias\" through \"point-wise distance sampling\" as explained by Hijmanns, 2012. Model prediction was made using the \"predict\" function to map the predictive risk of the diseases based on the values of the independent variables extracted from the environmental predictor rasters. A weighed average of the glm and SVM models were calculated using the AUCs for each BPD model and a final composite prediction was made.\\nTo analyze the impact of deforestation on the emergence of the BPDs, we conducted a detailed spatiotemporal analysis using the R package \"gfcanalytics\" on the Hansan's tree cover loss maps. We used the presence points at a spatial buffer of 100km, used for the BPD models, for this analysis.\\n.

We used glm and SVM methods of SDM for each of the disease. The AUC was maintained at an average of 0.9323 for glm models and 0.9597 for the SVM models. We have tabulated the AUC for each model in Table 1 .\\nThe distribution of the filovirus diseases, EVD and MVD, was restricted to the African subcontinent (Figures 1 & 2 \\nThe weighed means of the AUC from the BPD models were used to create a threshold and the potential hotspots for the emergence of disease X was mapped ( Figure 6 ).\\nOur study was the first to map the predictive risk of the disease emergence using species distribution models and to establish the impact of environmental factors on their emergence.

The results of our study have shown that the disease emergence is spatially dependent on the bioclimatic factors such as elevation, tree cover loss and climatic covariates. These factors could thus be utilized to identify and predict the hotspots of Disease X.\\nWe found elevation to have a significant influence on the distribution of Nipah and coronavirus diseases. Studies have hypothesized that Nipah emergence in lower Gangetic plains and at the low-lying backwaters could be attributed to flooding, which causes destruction of mammal habitats (17) . Rapid changes to habitats lead to starvation and migration of the known reservoirs of the Nipah virus, the bats, with contamination of fruit trees near human dwelling and increased exposure to the pathogen. Our results confirm this hypothesis associated with low-lying plains, flooding and emergence of Nipah disease. Coronaviruses are also linked with bat reservoirs. We hypothesize that similar events leading to destruction of bat habitats due to flooding at the lowlying regions such the wadis near Jeddah and Zhujiang Basin at the Province of Guangdong triggered the emergence of MERS and SARS respectively.\\nA recent study found that the increase in surface temperature and the unpredictability in the seasonal rainfall due to climate change, has an indirect effect on disease emergence through the sudden changes to the reservoirs habitats, biodiversity loss and small mammal migration (18) .\\nOur results demonstrate that increase in the residual temperature also known as the minimum temperature has a direct influence on the emergence and distribution of the BPDs. This direct spatial dependence of disease emergence on minimum temperatures is worrying. With climate change, the increasing night minimum temperatures lengthens the freeze-free season in most mid-and high latitude regions (19) . These conditions with worsening climate change could .

This hypothesis has been established from the vector-borne BPDs emergence predictions like CCHF and Zika (5, 20) .\\nOur study observed that deforestation is another important factor driving the emergence of BPDs. Studies have established the impact of deforestation and migration of bats on the occurrence of EVD, Nipah and SARS diseases (11, 21, 22) . Most of the models showed tree cover loss at 100km around the occurrence of the BPDs (see for example EVD, Figure 7 ). Biodiversity loss, due to anthropogenic changes to their habitat such as deforestation, land fragmentation for agriculture, increase in demand for protein and climate We hypothesize that a decrease in predators could cause an imbalance in the natural predator-prey equilibrium leading to an increase in small mammal reservoirs and thus to viruses transmission via disease vectors such as ticks. Lesser species diversity and inter-species interactions makes spillover easier towards the accidental human hosts. This has been termed as the \"dilution effect\" (23).\\nAs with all mathematical models, our study has its limitations. The size of the environmental predictor raster layers limited our spatial extent of the models. We chose the quality of the satellite imagery and resolution over a global perspective with poor or outdated data. Our study does not have a temporal component in the form of times series, which would be interesting especially with the climatic covariates. We mitigated this by choosing recent raster data corresponding to the period of the study and linking the spatiotemporal presence and pseudoabsence points to corresponding climatic monthly covariates. Despite these limitations, our study is the first to confirm the validity and effectiveness of using SDMs and other mathematical models to predict and identify the potential hotspots for BPDs. The use of a biogeographic approach in disease modelling offers a wider perspective on the environmental drivers and highlights the importance of climate change in the context of disease emergence.

It is interesting to note that the associated predictive risk map includes the region of Wuhan, the epicenter of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.\\nIn our study with the use of a biogeographic approach, satellite imagery and SDMs, we were able to identify Wuhan as a potential hotspot of disease emergence in the absence of COVID-19 data.\\nWe confirm that distribution of disease emergence in humans is spatially dependent on environmental factors such as landscape, tree cover loss and climatic covariates.

       "      <td>In December of 2019, the increasing number of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, Central China. Most of the early patients had directly or indirectly related to wild animal source in the seafood and wet animal wholesale market through epidemiological survey [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Then laboratory tests found that the infection was caused by a novel coronavirus (now named as COVID-19 6-7 ).\\nThe spread of COVID-19 is expeditious. According to WHO statistics, the total number of diagnosed people in China was 309 in Jan 21 8 , but rapidly grew to 4537 in Jan 27 9 . Considering a simple constant exponential growth rate model [10] [11] , the diagnosis number will be unimaginable soon. This triggered a major concern and motivated this study [12] [13] [14] . A mathematical model is required to predict the spread trend and emergent situation.\\nOver the last few decades, mathematical models of disease transmission have been useful to gain insights into the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and the potential role of intervention strategies 15 . Epidemic transmission models focused on the spread of an infectious disease through a population. But this spread can be modeled in two fundamental ways: by looking at the entire population as a single group or set of linked subgroups (population-based) or by considering everyone that makes up the population and how interactions between unique individuals facilitate disease spread (individual-based). Common models of infectious disease included meta-population models, individual-based network models, and simple SIR-type models that incorporate the effects of reactive behavior changes or inhomogeneous mixing 16 .\\nConsidering the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a simple but robust model is expected to work better than sophisticated epidemiology models. In this paper, we propose a robust model for next day diagnosis number predict. This model had excellent performance on prediction of infected patients in past few days. The prediction is expected to provide practical significance on social and economic application. &amp; # and its median aggregates were calculated (Fig.1) . It was observed that &amp; # manifests a random fluctuation around a constant center. It is reasonable to assume that is a constant. The estimation of currently (Feb 10) is 0.904. A future diagnosis number formula is obtained based on this estimation:\\nPrevious numbers of diagnoses in China are used to predict the number for the next day. The prediction is started from Jan 29 as several data points are needed to build the model (Table 1) . We obtain nice concordance (&lt;2.5% error) with the real numbers next day. \\nWe predict the new diagnosis number in China according to our model as Fig.2 . The model predicts that new diagnosis will last to March.\\nOur model indicates that the COVID-19 disease infection rate decreases exponentially. This model converges to a maximum number as time increases, indicating a limited impact of COVID-19. The model also predict that the new diagnosis number will last to March, indicating that the COVID-19 disease will be well controlled.\\nWe only analyzed the total number of diagnoses in China. The province scale data is available but is not as complete as total number. Here, we did not show these details analyses.\\nOur model is attractive as it not only predicts data accurately but also is minimal.\\n.

We develop a formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:\\n) \" ，and estimate that is 0.904( &lt;1) which shows that the diagnosis number of COVID-19 patients will decrease. It is very effective in controlling the spread of infectious diseases that the Chinese health authorities have taken appropriate health care actions. If the outbreak is no longer controlled, the value of will be around 1 indicating that the outbreak will wreak havoc. We obtain this elegant formula with both curve plot visualization and mathematical intuition. We plot ln (Ni/Ni-1) against time (Fig.3 ). First few observations showed a linear decay of spread rate. However, later data points realized us at Feb 4 that it is an exponential decay. Later data points further confirm our model. \\nDaily diagnosis number of China is download from WHO situation reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports). The data starts from Jan 21 and currently it ends at Feb 10.\\nThe following model is proposed based on our observations:\\nwhere Ni is the number of diagnosed patients in China according to WHO at the ith day, is a parameter modeling the decay of diagnosis growth rate. A simple estimation of at the ith day would be\\nAs we have multiple days of observations, historical &amp; # with the median statistic, which is well known for its robustness, can be aggregated.\\nThe source code of model estimation is at: https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/ncp_ model\\n</td>\n",

       "939  In December of 2019, the increasing number of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, Central China. Most of the early patients had directly or indirectly related to wild animal source in the seafood and wet animal wholesale market through epidemiological survey [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Then laboratory tests found that the infection was caused by a novel coronavirus (now named as COVID-19 6-7 ).\\nThe spread of COVID-19 is expeditious. According to WHO statistics, the total number of diagnosed people in China was 309 in Jan 21 8 , but rapidly grew to 4537 in Jan 27 9 . Considering a simple constant exponential growth rate model [10] [11] , the diagnosis number will be unimaginable soon. This triggered a major concern and motivated this study [12] [13] [14] . A mathematical model is required to predict the spread trend and emergent situation.\\nOver the last few decades, mathematical models of disease transmission have been useful to gain insights into the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and the potential role of intervention strategies 15 . Epidemic transmission models focused on the spread of an infectious disease through a population. But this spread can be modeled in two fundamental ways: by looking at the entire population as a single group or set of linked subgroups (population-based) or by considering everyone that makes up the population and how interactions between unique individuals facilitate disease spread (individual-based). Common models of infectious disease included meta-population models, individual-based network models, and simple SIR-type models that incorporate the effects of reactive behavior changes or inhomogeneous mixing 16 .\\nConsidering the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a simple but robust model is expected to work better than sophisticated epidemiology models. In this paper, we propose a robust model for next day diagnosis number predict. This model had excellent performance on prediction of infected patients in past few days. The prediction is expected to provide practical significance on social and economic application. & # and its median aggregates were calculated (Fig.1) . It was observed that & # manifests a random fluctuation around a constant center. It is reasonable to assume that is a constant. The estimation of currently (Feb 10) is 0.904. A future diagnosis number formula is obtained based on this estimation:\\nPrevious numbers of diagnoses in China are used to predict the number for the next day. The prediction is started from Jan 29 as several data points are needed to build the model (Table 1) . We obtain nice concordance (<2.5% error) with the real numbers next day. \\nWe predict the new diagnosis number in China according to our model as Fig.2 . The model predicts that new diagnosis will last to March.\\nOur model indicates that the COVID-19 disease infection rate decreases exponentially. This model converges to a maximum number as time increases, indicating a limited impact of COVID-19. The model also predict that the new diagnosis number will last to March, indicating that the COVID-19 disease will be well controlled.\\nWe only analyzed the total number of diagnoses in China. The province scale data is available but is not as complete as total number. Here, we did not show these details analyses.\\nOur model is attractive as it not only predicts data accurately but also is minimal.\\n.

We develop a formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:\\n) \" ，and estimate that is 0.904( <1) which shows that the diagnosis number of COVID-19 patients will decrease. It is very effective in controlling the spread of infectious diseases that the Chinese health authorities have taken appropriate health care actions. If the outbreak is no longer controlled, the value of will be around 1 indicating that the outbreak will wreak havoc. We obtain this elegant formula with both curve plot visualization and mathematical intuition. We plot ln (Ni/Ni-1) against time (Fig.3 ). First few observations showed a linear decay of spread rate. However, later data points realized us at Feb 4 that it is an exponential decay. Later data points further confirm our model. \\nDaily diagnosis number of China is download from WHO situation reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports). The data starts from Jan 21 and currently it ends at Feb 10.\\nThe following model is proposed based on our observations:\\nwhere Ni is the number of diagnosed patients in China according to WHO at the ith day, is a parameter modeling the decay of diagnosis growth rate. A simple estimation of at the ith day would be\\nAs we have multiple days of observations, historical & # with the median statistic, which is well known for its robustness, can be aggregated.\\nThe source code of model estimation is at: https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/ncp_ model\\n  "

       "      <td>In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures.\\nA population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities.\\nProportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4%\\n(102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p&lt;0·001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p&lt;0·001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2%\\n(52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p&lt;0·001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p&lt;0·001). 79.0%\\n(403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P&lt;0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures.\\nAll rights reserved.

We identified 179 studies, most of which are research on clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. To date there is no primary research to quantify public behavioural response and support in containment measures in response to the outbreak.\\nOnly four commentaries mentioned the influence of the outbreak on mental health. One commentary introduced the habit of consuming wild animal products in China. Another commentary briefly introduced isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment as public health measures in the outbreak. The Chinese government has introduced a series of strict containment measures, and societal acceptability of these measure is important for effective and sustained response.\\nEvidence is urgently needed to help policy makers understand public response to the outbreak and support for the containment measures, but no evidence available to date.\\nWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random digital dialing in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020.\\nTo date, this is the only few analyses on behavioural response to the outbreak and societal acceptability of governmental containment measures, which has been listed as the current priority of China CDC. We provide an assessment of behavioural change on exposure to live animals during the outbreak, by comparison before and during the outbreak, and between two cities with diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. We also provide evidence on public support in governmental containment measures, including strict regulation on wet markets to reduce animal-to-human transmission and city quarantine All rights reserved.

The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and significantly reduced exposure to live animals and stopped wild animal consumption, especially in Wuhan. They were very supportive of governmental containment measures. With high public support, wet markets should be better regulated, and healthy diets, including changing the traditional habit of eating wild animal products, should be promoted. This can inform policy makers in China and other countries to implement and adjust containment strategies in response to the outbreak in the future.\\nEarly in December 2019, several pneumonia cases caused by the novel coronavirus (now known as were first reported in Wuhan city, China. [1] [2] [3] The majority of the earliest cases were epidemiologically traced to the local Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market, where some wild animals were sold. [1] [2] [3] [4] On Jan 26, novel coronavirus was detected in environmental samples from this market by China CDC, suggesting that the virus possibly originated in wild animals sold in the market. [3] [4] This pathogenic virus has been identified as a new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). [4] [5] The COVID-19 outbreak was declared by World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Jan 30, 2020. 6 As of Feb 16, 2020, a total of 70,548 cases have been reported in mainland China, with 1,770 resulting deaths. 7 The outbreak has now spread beyond China to twenty-five other countries. 8 The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were proven to have originated from wild animals. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The COVID-19 is also likely to have a zoonotic origin. The practice of consuming wild animal products in China dates back to prehistoric times and persists into today. 9 Trade and consumption of wild animals were not well regulated even after SARS. Until the amendment of Wild Animal Protection Act in 2016, the prohibition was firstly added, but only for a short list of the nationally protected animals. Previous studies explored population exposure to live poultry in China, [15] [16] [17] but information on exposure to wild animals is limited.\\nIn the efforts to contain the spread of the virus, the Chinese government introduced a series of All rights reserved.

Furthermore, Wuhan city has been quarantined to stop human-to-human transmission: starting on Jan 23, 2020, public transportation in Wuhan was closed, and all flights and trains leaving from Wuhan were cancelled.\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent containment measures to lower the zoonotic virus transmission offer a unique opportunity to reassess the exposure to live animals, demand for wild animal consumption, and public readiness to further regulate wet markets. In this study, we aim to investigate behaviour patterns of population interaction to live animals, with a particular focus on differences before and during the outbreak, between Wuhan and Shanghai representing diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. We also seek to understand levels of public support for containment measures and public confidence in their effectiveness to quell the outbreak. This study will help to clarify the public's response to the outbreak and has important policy implications regarding the social acceptability of infection containment measures and their application in different contexts.\\nA population-based cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Wuhan and Shanghai between Feb 1 and 10, 2020, one month since the outbreak. These two cities were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. Wuhan is the site of origin of the COVID-19 outbreak. Shanghai was selected due to its status as a city that has been significantly affected by imported COVID-19 cases All rights reserved.

The first imported case was confirmed in Shanghai on Jan 20. During the period of our survey, the number of confirmed cases rose rapidly in Wuhan, from 4,109 to 18,454, but maintained low epidemic rates in Shanghai, with reported cases rising from 182 to 303. Figure 1 illustrates the timeline of the outbreak progression and containment measures. This provides an opportunity to assess and compare public behavioural response and support for containment measures during the outbreak between two cities with different exposure intensities.\\nThe sample size (n=500 for each city) is sufficient to estimate the change of outcomes (p=0.5) with a margin of error of 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval, according to previous studies. [15] [16] Our target population was persons aged 18 or over who had been living in the selected city for at least 6 months in the year prior to the survey and were current residents at the time of the survey. In each city, the telephone survey was conducted through a computer-assisted interviewing system, which enabled the random generation of mobile phone numbers and systematic data collection. We attempted to contact each generated number three times a day at different hours; if no contact was established after the third call, this number was classified as invalid or unreachable. Random dials with proportional quota sampling were used to ensure that respondents were demographically representative of the general population in each city, with quotas based on sex and age. 19\\nThe outcomes of interest we studied were exposure to live animals before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, public support for containment measures that aim to reduce population exposure to live animals and human transmission, and confidence in these measures to quell the outbreak.

To measure behavioural change during the outbreak, each respondent was asked to report exposing behaviours both (1) prior to the outbreak: before Dec 31, 2019 when COVID-19 cases were first released by Wuhan Health Commission and (2) since the outbreak, between Jan 1 to Feb 10, 2020. For live animal consumption habits, where behaviour change cannot be measured in a short period of time, we assessed people's intention to: 1) buy live poultry or wild animals, and eat wild animal products (continue to buy/eat as usual, buy/eat less, not buy/eat any more) and 2) continue raising pets and touching stray animals (continue to raise/touch as usual, temporarily not during the outbreak, try or resolutely not even after the outbreak).\\nWe measured public support for two types of governmental containment measures in response to the outbreak; one is regulation on wet markets to reduce population exposure to live animals, and the other is quarantining measures meant to reduce human transmission, such as the closure of public transportation in Wuhan and the cancellation of flights and trains leaving from Wuhan. Each respondent was asked to rate the extent, on a five-point Likert scale, to which they supported 1) the permanent closure of LPMs, 2) a ban on the wild animal trade, and 3) the quarantining of Wuhan; respondents were also asked to report the extent of their confidence in the effectiveness of these measures to quell the outbreak.\\nCharacteristics of respondents, including gender, age, marital status, education, income, and All rights reserved.

We also collected the history of fever or cough symptoms for respondents and their relatives or friends in the two weeks prior to the survey, and whether there were confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in the neighbourhood in which they live.\\nEach respondent was also asked at what point they started paying attention to this outbreak.\\nThe survey questionnaire was adjusted according to an instrument used during the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 20-21 and influenza A(H7N9) in 2013. 15 The survey instrument was pretested for face and content validity, length, and understandability by the public before our survey was administered.\\nDescriptive and univariate analysis were used to investigate changes in exposure to live animals during the outbreak, public support for containment measures, and confidence in containment measures to quell the outbreak, between Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases).\\nChi-square tests or fisher's exact tests (when applicable) were used to compare differences in these measures between the two cities, and before and during the outbreak. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate factors associated with public support for containment measures and confidence in intervention effectiveness. The proportion and Odds Ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\\nA total of 18,576 telephone numbers were randomly selected via digital dialing system in Wuhan and Shanghai.

In total, 510 respondents in Wuhan and 501 respondents in Shanghai completed the interview, and the overall response rate was 14.8%\\n(1,011/6,836) (Appendix Figure 1 ).\\nRespondents in Wuhan and Shanghai were generally similar in terms of sex, marital status and occupation, but in Shanghai respondents tended to be older and had higher education and income levels than in Wuhan (Table 1 ). Our sample was consistent with characteristics of the general population in the two cities, as Shanghai is more developed and has an older population than Wuhan. Expectedly, respondents in Wuhan were much more intensely exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak and paid attention to the outbreak earlier than those in Shanghai.\\nWe first investigated patterns of usual exposure to live animals before the outbreak ( Table 2 Panel of 55, 58.2% in Shanghai, p=0.339); more than 90% of respondents always arranged for slaughter of purchased animals in wet markets, with no noticeable differences between the two cities.

We found that respondents dramatically reduced exposure to live animals during the outbreak, with respondents in Wuhan changing their exposure much more significantly than in Shanghai. Specifically, the frequency of visiting LPMs decreased from 23.3% (n=119) to 3.1% (n=16)\\nin Wuhan (p&lt;0·001), and from 20.4% (n=102) to 4.4%(n=22) in Shanghai (p&lt;0·001; Figure 2 ). The proportion of respondents buying live poultry or wild animals also decreased from around 11.0% to 2.6% in both cities (p&lt;0·001). We also asked whether respondents intended to change their habit of buying live poultry or wild animals since the outbreak among those exposing to live animals at usual ( (4/55) of respondents in Wuhan and 25.5% (14/55) in Shanghai stated they would continue to buy these products as usual.\\nThe proportion of respondents consuming wild animals declined significantly, 10.2%(n=52) to 0.6%(n=3) in Wuhan (p&lt;0·001) and 5.2%(n=26) to 0.8%(n=4) in Shanghai (p&lt;0·001) (Figure 2 ).

Table 3 presents socio-demographic factors associated with public support for the governmental containment measures implemented (i.e. closure of LPMs, banning the wild animal trade, and city quarantine) and confidence in the effectiveness of governmental response.

We did not find any difference in population profiles of those who support Wuhan quarantine or show confidence in the effectiveness of governmental response.\\nThis study is the first to investigate behavioural changes of exposure to live animals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and public support for governmental containment measures in response to the outbreak. We found that population exposures to live animals were similar in Wuhan and Shanghai before the outbreak, except that wild animal consumption was more prevalent in Wuhan than in Shanghai. During the outbreak, residents in both cities significantly changed their behaviours and reduced exposures to live animals, and such changes were much more significant in Wuhan. Most respondents supported governmental containment measures implemented, and three in four had confidence on the effectiveness of these measures. Male, the less educated and those exposing to live animals at usual were less likely to support containment measures.\\nIn our survey, more than 20% of respondents visited wet markets at usual, which was similar in Wuhan and Shanghai, despite Shanghai being much more developed. Compared with the 30% level reported in 2013 in the same study sites, 15 the share of respondents visiting wet markets declined by 10 percentage points, but was still high. 10% of respondents consumed products of wild animals in Wuhan, twice that reported in Shanghai. In China, there exists a long tradition of eating the meat and products of wild animals, which persists into modern times due to a false but commonly held belief that these products All rights reserved.

[22] [23] These beliefs and preferences for fresh food are especially popular in southern China, where Wuhan is located, but were greatly challenged and changed during the 2003 SARS outbreak in China 9,12 . However, these practices have become popular again in recent years, due in part to the popularity of social media influencers who broadcast themselves eating wild animal products on livestream platforms. 22 The revival of this tradition may have set the socio-biological context for the occurrence and spread of COVID-19 in China.\\nWe found that respondents' risks of exposure to live animals declined significantly, reaching a very low level, and most respondents stopped wild animal consumption after this outbreak, especially in Wuhan.\\nThis indicates that the public responded quickly and adequately to the outbreak. In the survey, all respondents cared about the outbreak, and about one in five respondents in Wuhan reported starting to pay attention before Dec 31, 2019. The outbreak gradually gained intense nationwide attention, 24 and a series of policies were implemented by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak. As of Jan 30, all provinces had initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. [25] [26] These actions raised public attention further and induced significant behavioural changes. A national online survey on Jan 26 showed that the vast majority of people knew of the disease and related preventive measures, 66.5% reported that they would wear masks when outside their home, and 80% cancelled travel plans during the Spring Festival due to the outbreak. 27 The findings from both this survey and ours demonstrate behavioural change in terms of exposure to live animals or daily protection.\\nIn addition, more strict regulations were implemented on wet markets to lower the risk of disease transmission. Wuhan instituted prohibited the sale of live poultry and wild animals starting on Jan 22. All rights reserved.

The Chinese Government further instituted nationwide bans on all forms of wild animal transactions on Jan 26. 28 These regulations may accelerate the decrease in exposing behaviours to live animals. However, the COVID-19 epidemic occurred prior to the Chinese lunar new year, when the demand for live animals is generally high. 23 This may produce a conflict between the public demand for live animals and regulations. Fortunately, we found that the public strongly supports the regulations on wet markets to control the outbreak.\\nAlthough permanent closure of LPMs was not fully backed by the public, it was still much higher than reported during the 2013 influenza A outbreak (27.3% in Wuhan, 39.3% in Shanghai). 15, 29 The strong support for this policy offers a great opportunity to improve regulations on wet markets and change the prevalent habit of eating wild animal products in China.\\nWe believe that the keys to quelling outbreaks of zoonotic viral diseases such as COVID-19 and preventing future outbreaks are changing the false beliefs and dangerous habits regarding eating wild animal products and strengthening regulations on wet markets. Firstly, healthy diets need to be vigorously promoted in China. Health China 2030 promotes healthy diets, but does not discuss the risks of eating wild animals. We also believe the internet and social media can be an effective channel to promote healthy eating habits and reduce the inappropriate and outdated tradition of eating wild animal products. 25, 30 Since the outbreak, spontaneous initiatives have emerged on the internet to explain the risks of and resist consuming wild animals. Secondly, live animal transactions should be more strictly regulated, and wild animal transactions should be even prohibited in the long term. While different animals should be sold separately in specific wet markets to lower risks of virus transmission, in practice, various kinds of live animals are sold together within one market, as found in Huanan Seafood All rights reserved.

Laws should be strengthened to regulate and implement the strict separation of live animals from general markets. With the currently high public support, bans on the wild animal trade should be promoted, but the government must be aware of the risk of creating an unregulated black market by instituting a ban. For live poultry and non-wild animals, better regulations may be a better option than bans without the full support of the public. 23 The feasible measures include seasonal closure of wet markets, regular rest days, and banning leaving live animals in markets overnight. 10, 15 The above measures should be given priority in China and other countries to reduce current levels of COVID-19, as well as future threats from zoonotic diseases.\\nOur study has several limitations. First, there may be recall bias. We aimed to identify behavioral changes in a cross-sectional survey, and outcomes before the outbreak were measured based on participant recall. Second, our results may be affected by selection bias from telephone survey. We did attempt multiple calls to unanswered numbers to mitigate this bias, and quota sampling was introduced to get a representative sample. The anonymous phone interview addressed the concern of response bias due to fear of being seen as criticizing the government. Third, a cross-sectional design prevents us from assessing how long the effect on behavioral/intention change demonstrated in this study will last, when the outbreak is no longer fresh in people's minds. Thus, we plan to conduct a second-round survey at the end of the outbreak to track the long-term changes.\\nIn conclusion, exposure to live animals was common before the COVID-19 outbreak. The public responded quickly to this outbreak, and significantly reduced their exposure to live animals and stopped wild animal consumption, especially in Wuhan.

       "1221  In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures.\\nA population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities.\\nProportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4%\\n(102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0·001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0·001).

We identified 179 studies, most of which are research on clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. To date there is no primary research to quantify public behavioural response and support in containment measures in response to the outbreak.\\nOnly four commentaries mentioned the influence of the outbreak on mental health. One commentary introduced the habit of consuming wild animal products in China. Another commentary briefly introduced isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment as public health measures in the outbreak. The Chinese government has introduced a series of strict containment measures, and societal acceptability of these measure is important for effective and sustained response.\\nEvidence is urgently needed to help policy makers understand public response to the outbreak and support for the containment measures, but no evidence available to date.\\nWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random digital dialing in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020.\\nTo date, this is the only few analyses on behavioural response to the outbreak and societal acceptability of governmental containment measures, which has been listed as the current priority of China CDC. We provide an assessment of behavioural change on exposure to live animals during the outbreak, by comparison before and during the outbreak, and between two cities with diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19.

The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and significantly reduced exposure to live animals and stopped wild animal consumption, especially in Wuhan. They were very supportive of governmental containment measures. With high public support, wet markets should be better regulated, and healthy diets, including changing the traditional habit of eating wild animal products, should be promoted. This can inform policy makers in China and other countries to implement and adjust containment strategies in response to the outbreak in the future.\\nEarly in December 2019, several pneumonia cases caused by the novel coronavirus (now known as were first reported in Wuhan city, China. [1] [2] [3] The majority of the earliest cases were epidemiologically traced to the local Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market, where some wild animals were sold. [1] [2] [3] [4] On Jan 26, novel coronavirus was detected in environmental samples from this market by China CDC, suggesting that the virus possibly originated in wild animals sold in the market. [3] [4] This pathogenic virus has been identified as a new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). [4] [5] The COVID-19 outbreak was declared by World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Jan 30, 2020. 6 As of Feb 16, 2020, a total of 70,548 cases have been reported in mainland China, with 1,770 resulting deaths. 7 The outbreak has now spread beyond China to twenty-five other countries. 8 The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were proven to have originated from wild animals. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The COVID-19 is also likely to have a zoonotic origin. The practice of consuming wild animal products in China dates back to prehistoric times and persists into today. 9 Trade and consumption of wild animals were not well regulated even after SARS. Until the amendment of Wild Animal Protection Act in 2016, the prohibition was firstly added, but only for a short list of the nationally protected animals. Previous studies explored population exposure to live poultry in China, [15] [16] [17] but information on exposure to wild animals is limited.\\nIn the efforts to contain the spread of the virus, the Chinese government introduced a series of All rights reserved.

Furthermore, Wuhan city has been quarantined to stop human-to-human transmission: starting on Jan 23, 2020, public transportation in Wuhan was closed, and all flights and trains leaving from Wuhan were cancelled.\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent containment measures to lower the zoonotic virus transmission offer a unique opportunity to reassess the exposure to live animals, demand for wild animal consumption, and public readiness to further regulate wet markets. In this study, we aim to investigate behaviour patterns of population interaction to live animals, with a particular focus on differences before and during the outbreak, between Wuhan and Shanghai representing diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. We also seek to understand levels of public support for containment measures and public confidence in their effectiveness to quell the outbreak. This study will help to clarify the public's response to the outbreak and has important policy implications regarding the social acceptability of infection containment measures and their application in different contexts.\\nA population-based cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Wuhan and Shanghai between Feb 1 and 10, 2020, one month since the outbreak. These two cities were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. Wuhan is the site of origin of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The first imported case was confirmed in Shanghai on Jan 20. During the period of our survey, the number of confirmed cases rose rapidly in Wuhan, from 4,109 to 18,454, but maintained low epidemic rates in Shanghai, with reported cases rising from 182 to 303. Figure 1 illustrates the timeline of the outbreak progression and containment measures. This provides an opportunity to assess and compare public behavioural response and support for containment measures during the outbreak between two cities with different exposure intensities.\\nThe sample size (n=500 for each city) is sufficient to estimate the change of outcomes (p=0.5) with a margin of error of 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval, according to previous studies. [15] [16] Our target population was persons aged 18 or over who had been living in the selected city for at least 6 months in the year prior to the survey and were current residents at the time of the survey. In each city, the telephone survey was conducted through a computer-assisted interviewing system, which enabled the random generation of mobile phone numbers and systematic data collection. We attempted to contact each generated number three times a day at different hours; if no contact was established after the third call, this number was classified as invalid or unreachable. Random dials with proportional quota sampling were used to ensure that respondents were demographically representative of the general population in each city, with quotas based on sex and age. 19\\nThe outcomes of interest we studied were exposure to live animals before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, public support for containment measures that aim to reduce population exposure to live animals and human transmission, and confidence in these measures to quell the outbreak.

To measure behavioural change during the outbreak, each respondent was asked to report exposing behaviours both (1) prior to the outbreak: before Dec 31, 2019 when COVID-19 cases were first released by Wuhan Health Commission and (2) since the outbreak, between Jan 1 to Feb 10, 2020. For live animal consumption habits, where behaviour change cannot be measured in a short period of time, we assessed people's intention to: 1) buy live poultry or wild animals, and eat wild animal products (continue to buy/eat as usual, buy/eat less, not buy/eat any more) and 2) continue raising pets and touching stray animals (continue to raise/touch as usual, temporarily not during the outbreak, try or resolutely not even after the outbreak).\\nWe measured public support for two types of governmental containment measures in response to the outbreak; one is regulation on wet markets to reduce population exposure to live animals, and the other is quarantining measures meant to reduce human transmission, such as the closure of public transportation in Wuhan and the cancellation of flights and trains leaving from Wuhan. Each respondent was asked to rate the extent, on a five-point Likert scale, to which they supported 1) the permanent closure of LPMs, 2) a ban on the wild animal trade, and 3) the quarantining of Wuhan; respondents were also asked to report the extent of their confidence in the effectiveness of these measures to quell the outbreak.\\nCharacteristics of respondents, including gender, age, marital status, education, income, and All rights reserved.

We also collected the history of fever or cough symptoms for respondents and their relatives or friends in the two weeks prior to the survey, and whether there were confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in the neighbourhood in which they live.\\nEach respondent was also asked at what point they started paying attention to this outbreak.\\nThe survey questionnaire was adjusted according to an instrument used during the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 20-21 and influenza A(H7N9) in 2013. 15 The survey instrument was pretested for face and content validity, length, and understandability by the public before our survey was administered.\\nDescriptive and univariate analysis were used to investigate changes in exposure to live animals during the outbreak, public support for containment measures, and confidence in containment measures to quell the outbreak, between Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases).\\nChi-square tests or fisher's exact tests (when applicable) were used to compare differences in these measures between the two cities, and before and during the outbreak. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate factors associated with public support for containment measures and confidence in intervention effectiveness.

In total, 510 respondents in Wuhan and 501 respondents in Shanghai completed the interview, and the overall response rate was 14.8%\\n(1,011/6,836) (Appendix Figure 1 ).\\nRespondents in Wuhan and Shanghai were generally similar in terms of sex, marital status and occupation, but in Shanghai respondents tended to be older and had higher education and income levels than in Wuhan (Table 1 ). Our sample was consistent with characteristics of the general population in the two cities, as Shanghai is more developed and has an older population than Wuhan. Expectedly, respondents in Wuhan were much more intensely exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak and paid attention to the outbreak earlier than those in Shanghai.\\nWe first investigated patterns of usual exposure to live animals before the outbreak ( Table 2 Panel of 55, 58.2% in Shanghai, p=0.339); more than 90% of respondents always arranged for slaughter of purchased animals in wet markets, with no noticeable differences between the two cities.

We found that respondents dramatically reduced exposure to live animals during the outbreak, with respondents in Wuhan changing their exposure much more significantly than in Shanghai. Specifically, the frequency of visiting LPMs decreased from 23.3% (n=119) to 3.1% (n=16)\\nin Wuhan (p<0·001), and from 20.4% (n=102) to 4.4%(n=22) in Shanghai (p<0·001; Figure 2 ). The proportion of respondents buying live poultry or wild animals also decreased from around 11.0% to 2.6% in both cities (p<0·001). We also asked whether respondents intended to change their habit of buying live poultry or wild animals since the outbreak among those exposing to live animals at usual ( (4/55) of respondents in Wuhan and 25.5% (14/55) in Shanghai stated they would continue to buy these products as usual.\\nThe proportion of respondents consuming wild animals declined significantly, 10.2%(n=52) to 0.6%(n=3) in Wuhan (p<0·001) and 5.2%(n=26) to 0.8%(n=4) in Shanghai (p<0·001) (Figure 2 ).

We did not find any difference in population profiles of those who support Wuhan quarantine or show confidence in the effectiveness of governmental response.\\nThis study is the first to investigate behavioural changes of exposure to live animals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and public support for governmental containment measures in response to the outbreak. We found that population exposures to live animals were similar in Wuhan and Shanghai before the outbreak, except that wild animal consumption was more prevalent in Wuhan than in Shanghai. During the outbreak, residents in both cities significantly changed their behaviours and reduced exposures to live animals, and such changes were much more significant in Wuhan. Most respondents supported governmental containment measures implemented, and three in four had confidence on the effectiveness of these measures. Male, the less educated and those exposing to live animals at usual were less likely to support containment measures.\\nIn our survey, more than 20% of respondents visited wet markets at usual, which was similar in Wuhan and Shanghai, despite Shanghai being much more developed. Compared with the 30% level reported in 2013 in the same study sites, 15 the share of respondents visiting wet markets declined by 10 percentage points, but was still high. 10% of respondents consumed products of wild animals in Wuhan, twice that reported in Shanghai.

[22] [23] These beliefs and preferences for fresh food are especially popular in southern China, where Wuhan is located, but were greatly challenged and changed during the 2003 SARS outbreak in China 9,12 . However, these practices have become popular again in recent years, due in part to the popularity of social media influencers who broadcast themselves eating wild animal products on livestream platforms. 22 The revival of this tradition may have set the socio-biological context for the occurrence and spread of COVID-19 in China.\\nWe found that respondents' risks of exposure to live animals declined significantly, reaching a very low level, and most respondents stopped wild animal consumption after this outbreak, especially in Wuhan.\\nThis indicates that the public responded quickly and adequately to the outbreak. In the survey, all respondents cared about the outbreak, and about one in five respondents in Wuhan reported starting to pay attention before Dec 31, 2019. The outbreak gradually gained intense nationwide attention, 24 and a series of policies were implemented by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak. As of Jan 30, all provinces had initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. [25] [26] These actions raised public attention further and induced significant behavioural changes. A national online survey on Jan 26 showed that the vast majority of people knew of the disease and related preventive measures, 66.5% reported that they would wear masks when outside their home, and 80% cancelled travel plans during the Spring Festival due to the outbreak. 27 The findings from both this survey and ours demonstrate behavioural change in terms of exposure to live animals or daily protection.\\nIn addition, more strict regulations were implemented on wet markets to lower the risk of disease transmission.

The Chinese Government further instituted nationwide bans on all forms of wild animal transactions on Jan 26. 28 These regulations may accelerate the decrease in exposing behaviours to live animals. However, the COVID-19 epidemic occurred prior to the Chinese lunar new year, when the demand for live animals is generally high. 23 This may produce a conflict between the public demand for live animals and regulations. Fortunately, we found that the public strongly supports the regulations on wet markets to control the outbreak.\\nAlthough permanent closure of LPMs was not fully backed by the public, it was still much higher than reported during the 2013 influenza A outbreak (27.3% in Wuhan, 39.3% in Shanghai). 15, 29 The strong support for this policy offers a great opportunity to improve regulations on wet markets and change the prevalent habit of eating wild animal products in China.\\nWe believe that the keys to quelling outbreaks of zoonotic viral diseases such as COVID-19 and preventing future outbreaks are changing the false beliefs and dangerous habits regarding eating wild animal products and strengthening regulations on wet markets. Firstly, healthy diets need to be vigorously promoted in China. Health China 2030 promotes healthy diets, but does not discuss the risks of eating wild animals. We also believe the internet and social media can be an effective channel to promote healthy eating habits and reduce the inappropriate and outdated tradition of eating wild animal products. 25, 30 Since the outbreak, spontaneous initiatives have emerged on the internet to explain the risks of and resist consuming wild animals. Secondly, live animal transactions should be more strictly regulated, and wild animal transactions should be even prohibited in the long term. While different animals should be sold separately in specific wet markets to lower risks of virus transmission, in practice, various kinds of live animals are sold together within one market, as found in Huanan Seafood All rights reserved.

Laws should be strengthened to regulate and implement the strict separation of live animals from general markets. With the currently high public support, bans on the wild animal trade should be promoted, but the government must be aware of the risk of creating an unregulated black market by instituting a ban. For live poultry and non-wild animals, better regulations may be a better option than bans without the full support of the public. 23 The feasible measures include seasonal closure of wet markets, regular rest days, and banning leaving live animals in markets overnight. 10, 15 The above measures should be given priority in China and other countries to reduce current levels of COVID-19, as well as future threats from zoonotic diseases.\\nOur study has several limitations. First, there may be recall bias. We aimed to identify behavioral changes in a cross-sectional survey, and outcomes before the outbreak were measured based on participant recall. Second, our results may be affected by selection bias from telephone survey. We did attempt multiple calls to unanswered numbers to mitigate this bias, and quota sampling was introduced to get a representative sample. The anonymous phone interview addressed the concern of response bias due to fear of being seen as criticizing the government. Third, a cross-sectional design prevents us from assessing how long the effect on behavioral/intention change demonstrated in this study will last, when the outbreak is no longer fresh in people's minds. Thus, we plan to conduct a second-round survey at the end of the outbreak to track the long-term changes.\\nIn conclusion, exposure to live animals was common before the COVID-19 outbreak. The public responded quickly to this outbreak, and significantly reduced their exposure to live animals and stopped wild animal consumption, especially in Wuhan.

Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffer's rank model, Fotheringham's competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffer's rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffer's model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease.

       "      <td>Accurately predicting the geographical spread of emerging, re-emerging, and recurrent 14 epidemics in an increasingly globalized world is a matter of international urgency in the 15 wake of outbreaks of emerging pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 16 (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and ebola virus disease (EBVD) as 17 well as re-emerging and resurgent pathogens such as influenza subtype A-H1N1, 18 whooping cough, and measles. In response to this challenge, various 'spatial interaction' 19 models describing human movement as a function of population distribution have been 20 proposed. Some of these borrow from economics and human geography while others 21 adapt models from movement ecology and the physics of reaction and diffusion on 22 heterogenous landscapes. 23 In recent years, the field has seen the widespread adoption of a family of so-called 24 'gravity' models from transportation theory and human geography (see, e.g., [1, 2] ). In 25 its most common form, the gravity model posits that the migration flux between a pair 26 of cities is log-linearly dependent on their respective sizes and on their separating 27 distance. The application of this simple model to disease spread was originally proposed 28 by Murray and Cliff [3] , but over the last decade, many studies have used it to explain 29 historical, or predict future, disease spread in a range of infections including measles [4] , 30 influenza [5] [6] [7] , cholera [8] , and yellow fever [9] . While its application has yielded 31 insights, the geography literature has highlighted a prominent shortcoming of the 32 gravity model. In particular, these models ignore the potential for competitive or 33 synergistic interactions among population centers ( Fig. 1 ; [10, 11] ). Thus, for example, 34 movement between Boston and Washington DC is assumed to be unaffected by the 35 presence of the intervening city of New York. 36 As it happens, there are distinct families of models, arising from economics and 37 geography, that predict human movement patterns while allowing for higher-order 38 interactions among cities. In particular, Stouffer's [12] 'law of intervening opportunities' 39 posits that \"the number of persons going a given distance is directly proportional to the 40 number of opportunities at that distance and inversely proportional to the number of 41 intervening opportunities\". This idea has given rise to alternative models for human can feed back onto migration. Most obviously, disease symptoms can influence 53 movement behavior, as seen, for example, in the fact that a mild cold may induce 54 minimal changes in movement behavior but severe hemorrhagic fever or acute paralytic 55 disease will typically slow the movement of the infected hosts. These two considerations 56 do not preclude the utility of spatial interaction models in the infectious disease context; 57 they do, however, complicate their use and the importance of understanding 58 transmission relevant migration fluxes, which will be some sort of 'effective average' of 59 movement as filtered through such aforementioned complications.\\nSeveral spatial interaction models have been parameterized and tested using various 61 mobility data such as commuter flows (e.g., [5, 14] ), mobile phone geolocations 62 (e.g., [16] ), social media (e.g., [13] ), and microsimulations (e.g., [17] ). However, in view 63 of the challenges just noted, the ultimate test of the models is against data on the actual 64 spread of infection rather than bulk movement of people or cell phones. Bjørnstad and 65 Grenfell [18] proposed that for acute immunizing infections, the spatio-temporal 66 patterns of fade-outs (i.e., local disease extinction) across metapopulations provide 67 valuable information on disease spread because these patterns reflect spatial 68 transmission unclouded by local transmission. In this paper, we extract information 69 from fade-out patterns and a consistent likelihood framework to compare and contrast 70 to a suite of models including (i) the gravity model [1] , (ii) Fotheringham's competing 71 destinations model [10] , (iii) Stouffer's rank model [12] , and (iv) the radiation model [14] . 72 . We confront these models weekly data on measles incidence from all 954 cities and 73 towns in England and Wales from 1944 to 1965 [4, 19] . Comparing fits and predictions, 74 we show that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, Stouffer's 75 rank model, an extended version of the radiation model, and the competing destinations 76 model all provide significantly better fits, Stouffer's model performing the best.\\nData 79 Historical incidence of measles in England and Wales has been an influential testbed for 80 models and methods in disease dynamics since Bartlett's [20, 21] seminal work on its 81 recurrent epidemics. We use the spatially resolved weekly measles data across all 954 82 cities and towns of England and Wales from 1944, when notification was made 83 mandatory by the UK Registrar General (OPCS), until 1965, which saw subtle shifts in 84 political boundaries around London. Vaccination was not introduced in the UK until 85 1967, so that these data span a period where measles dynamics were unaffected by mass 86 immunization. The data set is complete except for a region-wide underreporting rate of 87 around 50% [22, 23] . Grenfell et al. [19] give a detailed description of the data; the 88 entire data set has been made available by Lau et al. [24] . 89 An important feature of the system is that, between 29% and 38% of the population 90 (c. 47M during this period) resided in a small number (13-28 depending on exact 91 definition) of communities above a critical community size (CCS) of c. 250-300k. Cities 92 larger than the CCS tend to sustain local chains of transmission. The remaining 60-70% 93 were distributed among the more than 900 communities smaller than the CCS where 94 local extinctions are more or less frequent (depending on population size and degree of 95 isolation) and, consequently, the rate of reintroduction of the pathogen via spatial 96 transmission is an important determinant of measles incidence. In ecological terms, the 97 prevaccination measles system represented an epidemic mainland-island metapopulation 98 (e.g., [25, 26] ). Our analysis exploits this fact, using the timing and spatial pattern and 99 timing of reintroductions to inform the parameters of each of the spatial interaction 100 models.\\nUsing a spatially-extended time series susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) framework 103 (e.g., [4, 27] ), we can calculate, for each population center, the probability that a spatial 104 interaction happens (i.e., a contact between a resident susceptible host and a 105 non-resident infectious host) and that the contact results in a new local chain of 106 transmission [18] . In previous analyses, we showed that the signature of such events will 107 be drowned out in the presence of endemic circulation (see [23] ). Following a local 108 extinction, however, the re-colonization rate contains critical information on the spatial 109 interactions.\\nThe spatially-extended TSIR model predicts that the expected number of new 111 infected hosts in community i in epidemic generation t + 1 will be\\nHere, β s(t) is the seasonal transmission rate as molded by opening and closing of schools 113 and the proportion of transmission that occurs within the school setting as the school 114 year progresses [23] ; s(t) = t mod 26 is the seasonality function; S i,t /N is the 115 probability that a local individual is susceptible; I i,t is the local number of infections; α 116 is a correction for the discrete-time approximation of the underlying continuous-time 117 process [28] ; and ι i,t is the sum of transmission-relevant spatial interactions i has with 118 the other communities in the epidemic metapopulation. Following a local extinction,\\nAssuming demographic stochasticity in transmission due to the underlying epidemic 121 birth-and-death process, the realized number of cases in the next generation will be [23] : 122\\nAs a consequence, the number of susceptibles in the next generation will be\\nwhere B i,t is the recruitment of local susceptibles through births during the generation 124 interval. The 'serial interval' for measles is 10-14 days [29] , so we follow previous TSIR 125 analyses in aggregating the weekly data in 2-week increments (though [23] investigate 126 shorter intervals). Using susceptible reconstruction methods [30] , we estimate all local 127 parameters using the method of Finkenstadt et al. [31] . The online supplement contains 128 full documentation of these analyses and code for exact replication of all results 129 presented in this paper.\\nConditioning on the local parameters and restricting analyses at each location to 131 biweeks in which measles incidence was zero, we use Eqs. 2 and 4 to form a negative 132 binomial likelihood to estimate all parameters of each of the candidate spatial 133 interaction models.\\nSpatial interaction models 135 When including special cases, such as pure diffusion and variants, we consider a total of 136 10 spatial interaction models (Fig. 1) . Each of these amounts to a specification of the ι 137 term in Eqs. 1 and 2.\\nGravity model. Under the gravity model, the spatial interaction between locations i 139 and j takes the form θN τ1 i N τ2 j d −ρ ij , where θ, τ 1 , τ 2 , and ρ are non-negative parameters. 140 This leads to the following formulation for disease-relevant spatial interactions:\\nwhere the sum is across all non-self potential donor communities, and I j /N j is the 142 fraction of infected individuals in donor community j. The gravity model has two 143 important special cases: ρ = 0, τ 1 = τ 2 = 1, which is a mean-field model, and 144 τ 1 = τ 2 = 0, which is simple spatial diffusion. The φ parameter represents background 145 spatial transmission that is not predictable on the basis of distance and size [24] . 146 Xia's model. In the original analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of measles, Xia et al. [4] used a formulation rooted in the gravity-model literature but with a slightly different formulation:\\nwhich is the same as Eq. 5 if τ 2 = 1, but not otherwise.\\nCompeting destinations model. Fotheringham [11] noted that gravity models may be misspecified because they only consider pairwise interactions among locations. He argued that nearby or intervening destinations may, in fact, make spatial interactions either more or less likely. A synergistic effect occurs, for example, if individuals are disproportionately inclined to do all their shopping in districts with many shops. Antagonistic effects may arise where travel between two cities, say Boston and Washington, is made less likely by the presence of an intervening city such as New York because individuals from either Boston or Washington can get their out-of-town needs fulfilled by visiting New York. Under Fotheringham's [11] competing destinations formulation the flux between i and j takes the form θ N τ1\\nAs in the gravity model, τ 1 and τ 2 control how 'eagerness to travel' and city 'attractiveness' scales with population size; and ρ measures how the likelihood of travel decays with distance. The parameter δ quantifies how destinations k, of various sizes, at distances d jk from the donor j, modulate the spatial interaction between recipient i and and donor j. In particular, δ &gt; 0 indicates a synergistic effect; δ &lt; 0, an antagonistic effect. The resultant formulation for disease-relevant spatial interactions between community i and everywhere else is:\\nwhere φ again represents background, spatially unpredictable spread. 148 Stouffer's rank model.

Despite their differences in 218 underlying mathematical equations, there must be more nuanced differences among the 219 models that contribute their relative fit/lack-of-fit.

Stouffer's 223 model and the competing destinations model have rarely been applied in this field. It is 224 therefore useful to use the gravity model fit as a baseline and explore how the 225 better-fitting models diverge from this baseline. Comparing matrices with half a million 226 entries is very difficult, so we amploy a new 'spatial likelihood contrast' (SLiC) method 227 with which to study the relative merit of the different spatial interaction models. The 228 idea is to disaggregate the overall hazard likelihoods by individual cities to study how 229 particular communities contribute to improved or diminished relative fit of each model. 230 To do so we normalize each location's contribution to the overall likelihood by the 231 number of data points each conurbation contributes to the likelihood (the accumulated 232 stretches of measles absence) and then map the model-model differences onto the 233 landscape (Fig. 3) . Inspection of Fig. 3 suggests that the poorer fit of the gravity model 234 vs. the Stouffer or competing destinations models is primarily in the urban northwest. 235 The supplement provides the full set of pairwise SLiC contrasts among all models. To 236 test whether the apparent patterns are statistically significant, we compute local 237 indicators of spatial association (LISA; [34] ) statistics for all population centers with 238 fewer than 50k inhabitants (Fig. 3A, B) . The main failure of the gravity model is in (e.g. [35, 36] ). In the case of epidemics playing out within a population center, models 254 closer to the mean field model (i.e., with uniform connectivity) often do remarkably well 255 (see [37] for a social network perspective on this). However, such models generally do 256 not capture regional spread of human infections because of the complicated patterns of 257 human movement (the third wave of the 2009 influenza pandemic across the USA, 258 perhaps, being an unusually diffusive counterexample [7] ) . To elucidate these patterns, 259 many empirical studies have been performed and a variety of abstractions have been 260 proposed. The task of choosing among these abstractions for help in help predicting 261 spread of infectious disease is complicated by the fact that (i) model formulations may 262 differ with respect to how well they actually reproduce aggregate mobility patterns, and 263 (ii) model fit may be shaped by the manner in which mobility is filtered by transmission 264 and behavior.\\nTo advance the discussion of these issues, we considered a suite of candidate models 266 of spatial interactions and fit them to the pre-vaccination measles data from England cases. The gravity model-which has gained recent prominence in infectious disease As the gravity model has had a very rapid adoption in spatial disease epidemiology 284 during the last decade (though Noulas et al. [13] have noted the importance of 285 considering alternatives), we used this as a baseline. Despite its common usage it 286 significantly under-performs relative to the several other models. Combining SLiC and 287 LISA statistics we found that the greatest tension between the gravity model and the 288 preferred alternatives is in the Manchester-Liverpool-Leeds conurbation of northwestern 289 England, where many towns and villages commingle amongst several major cities. formulation) that spatial interaction, once discounted for higher-order interference, is 295 roughly proportional to the geometric mean of the community sizes. This curious 296 suggestion warrants future investigation.\\nIn this study we have used actual disease incidence data, as opposed to raw 298 measurments of human movement, to further our understanding of the principles 299 governing how human hosts spread ifectious disease across a populated landscape. We 300 have found both strong evidence of higher-order interactions among population centers, 301 and that candidate models differ significantly in their ability to capture the empirical 302 patterns. We hope our findings will help stimulate a systematic, data-driven discussion 303 of the relative merit of alternative predictive models for the probable path for spatial 304 spread of infectious disease. Clearly, the prospects are good for good for further 305 refinements and improved parameterizations. Spatial interaction models predict the flux of human movements between population centers (cities, towns, villages) as a function of the distribution of the population on the landscape. In this diagram, the relative magnitude of the fluxes from a focal town to other population centers are represented by the widths of the arrows. In the widely-employed gravity models (A), interactions among cities is strictly pairwise. Thus the addition of a new town (B) has no effect on the movement to other towns. In Fotheringham's competing destinations model (C), however, competition or synergy among nearby communities can reduce or augment fluxes. Stouffer's model of intervening opportunities and the radiation model (D) posit that movement from one city to another is diminished by the presence of opportunities in communities more proximal to the source city. author/funder.

       "535  [{'text': 'Predictive models for the spatial spread of infectious diseases has received much attention in recent years as tools for the management of infectious diseas outbreaks. Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffer's rank model, Fotheringham's competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffer's rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffer's model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease. The supplemental materials contain all code for reproducing the results and applying the methods to other data sets.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': 'The ability to predict how infectious disease will spread is of great importance in the 1 face of the numerous emergent and re-emergent pathogens that currently threatening 2 : bioRxiv preprint human well-being. We identified a variety of alternative models that predict human 3 mobility as as a function of population distribution across a landscape. These consider 4 some models that account for pair-wise interactions between population centers, as well 5 as some that allow for higher-order interactions.

First, spatial 45 interaction models predict bulk migration fluxes between population centers, but the 46 impact of these movements on the dynamics of infectious disease can depend strongly 47 not only on the magnitude, but also on the composition, of the migrant pool. In 48 particular, the extent to which migrants are more or less likely to be susceptible to 49 infection, or actually infected, than the general population can be critically important, 50 as can the age profile of the migrant pool, due to pronounced age-specific patterns of 51 behavior, susceptibility, and infectiousness [5, 7, 15] .

       "535  Accurately predicting the geographical spread of emerging, re-emerging, and recurrent 14 epidemics in an increasingly globalized world is a matter of international urgency in the 15 wake of outbreaks of emerging pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 16 (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and ebola virus disease (EBVD) as 17 well as re-emerging and resurgent pathogens such as influenza subtype A-H1N1, 18 whooping cough, and measles. In response to this challenge, various 'spatial interaction' 19 models describing human movement as a function of population distribution have been 20 proposed. Some of these borrow from economics and human geography while others 21 adapt models from movement ecology and the physics of reaction and diffusion on 22 heterogenous landscapes. 23 In recent years, the field has seen the widespread adoption of a family of so-called 24 'gravity' models from transportation theory and human geography (see, e.g., [1, 2] ). In 25 its most common form, the gravity model posits that the migration flux between a pair 26 of cities is log-linearly dependent on their respective sizes and on their separating 27 distance. The application of this simple model to disease spread was originally proposed 28 by Murray and Cliff [3] , but over the last decade, many studies have used it to explain 29 historical, or predict future, disease spread in a range of infections including measles [4] , 30 influenza [5] [6] [7] , cholera [8] , and yellow fever [9] . While its application has yielded 31 insights, the geography literature has highlighted a prominent shortcoming of the 32 gravity model. In particular, these models ignore the potential for competitive or 33 synergistic interactions among population centers ( Fig. 1 ; [10, 11] ). Thus, for example, 34 movement between Boston and Washington DC is assumed to be unaffected by the 35 presence of the intervening city of New York. 36 As it happens, there are distinct families of models, arising from economics and 37 geography, that predict human movement patterns while allowing for higher-order 38 interactions among cities. In particular, Stouffer's [12] 'law of intervening opportunities' 39 posits that \"the number of persons going a given distance is directly proportional to the 40 number of opportunities at that distance and inversely proportional to the number of 41 intervening opportunities\". This idea has given rise to alternative models for human can feed back onto migration. Most obviously, disease symptoms can influence 53 movement behavior, as seen, for example, in the fact that a mild cold may induce 54 minimal changes in movement behavior but severe hemorrhagic fever or acute paralytic 55 disease will typically slow the movement of the infected hosts. These two considerations 56 do not preclude the utility of spatial interaction models in the infectious disease context; 57 they do, however, complicate their use and the importance of understanding 58 transmission relevant migration fluxes, which will be some sort of 'effective average' of 59 movement as filtered through such aforementioned complications.\\nSeveral spatial interaction models have been parameterized and tested using various 61 mobility data such as commuter flows (e.g., [5, 14] ), mobile phone geolocations 62 (e.g., [16] ), social media (e.g., [13] ), and microsimulations (e.g., [17] ). However, in view 63 of the challenges just noted, the ultimate test of the models is against data on the actual 64 spread of infection rather than bulk movement of people or cell phones. Bjørnstad and 65 Grenfell [18] proposed that for acute immunizing infections, the spatio-temporal 66 patterns of fade-outs (i.e., local disease extinction) across metapopulations provide 67 valuable information on disease spread because these patterns reflect spatial 68 transmission unclouded by local transmission. In this paper, we extract information 69 from fade-out patterns and a consistent likelihood framework to compare and contrast 70 to a suite of models including (i) the gravity model [1] , (ii) Fotheringham's competing 71 destinations model [10] , (iii) Stouffer's rank model [12] , and (iv) the radiation model [14] . 72 . We confront these models weekly data on measles incidence from all 954 cities and 73 towns in England and Wales from 1944 to 1965 [4, 19] . Comparing fits and predictions, 74 we show that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, Stouffer's 75 rank model, an extended version of the radiation model, and the competing destinations 76 model all provide significantly better fits, Stouffer's model performing the best.\\nData 79 Historical incidence of measles in England and Wales has been an influential testbed for 80 models and methods in disease dynamics since Bartlett's [20, 21] seminal work on its 81 recurrent epidemics. We use the spatially resolved weekly measles data across all 954 82 cities and towns of England and Wales from 1944, when notification was made 83 mandatory by the UK Registrar General (OPCS), until 1965, which saw subtle shifts in 84 political boundaries around London. Vaccination was not introduced in the UK until 85 1967, so that these data span a period where measles dynamics were unaffected by mass 86 immunization. The data set is complete except for a region-wide underreporting rate of 87 around 50% [22, 23] . Grenfell et al. [19] give a detailed description of the data; the 88 entire data set has been made available by Lau et al. [24] . 89 An important feature of the system is that, between 29% and 38% of the population 90 (c. 47M during this period) resided in a small number (13-28 depending on exact 91 definition) of communities above a critical community size (CCS) of c. 250-300k. Cities 92 larger than the CCS tend to sustain local chains of transmission. The remaining 60-70% 93 were distributed among the more than 900 communities smaller than the CCS where 94 local extinctions are more or less frequent (depending on population size and degree of 95 isolation) and, consequently, the rate of reintroduction of the pathogen via spatial 96 transmission is an important determinant of measles incidence. In ecological terms, the 97 prevaccination measles system represented an epidemic mainland-island metapopulation 98 (e.g., [25, 26] ). Our analysis exploits this fact, using the timing and spatial pattern and 99 timing of reintroductions to inform the parameters of each of the spatial interaction 100 models.\\nUsing a spatially-extended time series susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) framework 103 (e.g., [4, 27] ), we can calculate, for each population center, the probability that a spatial 104 interaction happens (i.e., a contact between a resident susceptible host and a 105 non-resident infectious host) and that the contact results in a new local chain of 106 transmission [18] . In previous analyses, we showed that the signature of such events will 107 be drowned out in the presence of endemic circulation (see [23] ). Following a local 108 extinction, however, the re-colonization rate contains critical information on the spatial 109 interactions.\\nThe spatially-extended TSIR model predicts that the expected number of new 111 infected hosts in community i in epidemic generation t + 1 will be\\nHere, β s(t) is the seasonal transmission rate as molded by opening and closing of schools 113 and the proportion of transmission that occurs within the school setting as the school 114 year progresses [23] ; s(t) = t mod 26 is the seasonality function; S i,t /N is the 115 probability that a local individual is susceptible; I i,t is the local number of infections; α 116 is a correction for the discrete-time approximation of the underlying continuous-time 117 process [28] ; and ι i,t is the sum of transmission-relevant spatial interactions i has with 118 the other communities in the epidemic metapopulation. Following a local extinction,\\nAssuming demographic stochasticity in transmission due to the underlying epidemic 121 birth-and-death process, the realized number of cases in the next generation will be [23] : 122\\nAs a consequence, the number of susceptibles in the next generation will be\\nwhere B i,t is the recruitment of local susceptibles through births during the generation 124 interval. The 'serial interval' for measles is 10-14 days [29] , so we follow previous TSIR 125 analyses in aggregating the weekly data in 2-week increments (though [23] investigate 126 shorter intervals). Using susceptible reconstruction methods [30] , we estimate all local 127 parameters using the method of Finkenstadt et al. [31] . The online supplement contains 128 full documentation of these analyses and code for exact replication of all results 129 presented in this paper.\\nConditioning on the local parameters and restricting analyses at each location to 131 biweeks in which measles incidence was zero, we use Eqs. 2 and 4 to form a negative 132 binomial likelihood to estimate all parameters of each of the candidate spatial 133 interaction models.\\nSpatial interaction models 135 When including special cases, such as pure diffusion and variants, we consider a total of 136 10 spatial interaction models (Fig. 1) . Each of these amounts to a specification of the ι 137 term in Eqs. 1 and 2.\\nGravity model. Under the gravity model, the spatial interaction between locations i 139 and j takes the form θN τ1 i N τ2 j d −ρ ij , where θ, τ 1 , τ 2 , and ρ are non-negative parameters. 140 This leads to the following formulation for disease-relevant spatial interactions:\\nwhere the sum is across all non-self potential donor communities, and I j /N j is the 142 fraction of infected individuals in donor community j. The gravity model has two 143 important special cases: ρ = 0, τ 1 = τ 2 = 1, which is a mean-field model, and 144 τ 1 = τ 2 = 0, which is simple spatial diffusion. The φ parameter represents background 145 spatial transmission that is not predictable on the basis of distance and size [24] . 146 Xia's model. In the original analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of measles, Xia et al. [4] used a formulation rooted in the gravity-model literature but with a slightly different formulation:\\nwhich is the same as Eq. 5 if τ 2 = 1, but not otherwise.\\nCompeting destinations model. Fotheringham [11] noted that gravity models may be misspecified because they only consider pairwise interactions among locations. He argued that nearby or intervening destinations may, in fact, make spatial interactions either more or less likely. A synergistic effect occurs, for example, if individuals are disproportionately inclined to do all their shopping in districts with many shops. Antagonistic effects may arise where travel between two cities, say Boston and Washington, is made less likely by the presence of an intervening city such as New York because individuals from either Boston or Washington can get their out-of-town needs fulfilled by visiting New York. Under Fotheringham's [11] competing destinations formulation the flux between i and j takes the form θ N τ1\\nAs in the gravity model, τ 1 and τ 2 control how 'eagerness to travel' and city 'attractiveness' scales with population size; and ρ measures how the likelihood of travel decays with distance. The parameter δ quantifies how destinations k, of various sizes, at distances d jk from the donor j, modulate the spatial interaction between recipient i and and donor j. In particular, δ > 0 indicates a synergistic effect; δ < 0, an antagonistic effect. The resultant formulation for disease-relevant spatial interactions between community i and everywhere else is:\\nwhere φ again represents background, spatially unpredictable spread. 148 Stouffer's rank model.

Stouffer's 223 model and the competing destinations model have rarely been applied in this field. It is 224 therefore useful to use the gravity model fit as a baseline and explore how the 225 better-fitting models diverge from this baseline. Comparing matrices with half a million 226 entries is very difficult, so we amploy a new 'spatial likelihood contrast' (SLiC) method 227 with which to study the relative merit of the different spatial interaction models. The 228 idea is to disaggregate the overall hazard likelihoods by individual cities to study how 229 particular communities contribute to improved or diminished relative fit of each model. 230 To do so we normalize each location's contribution to the overall likelihood by the 231 number of data points each conurbation contributes to the likelihood (the accumulated 232 stretches of measles absence) and then map the model-model differences onto the 233 landscape (Fig. 3) . Inspection of Fig. 3 suggests that the poorer fit of the gravity model 234 vs. the Stouffer or competing destinations models is primarily in the urban northwest. 235 The supplement provides the full set of pairwise SLiC contrasts among all models. To 236 test whether the apparent patterns are statistically significant, we compute local 237 indicators of spatial association (LISA; [34] ) statistics for all population centers with 238 fewer than 50k inhabitants (Fig. 3A, B) . The main failure of the gravity model is in (e.g. [35, 36] ). In the case of epidemics playing out within a population center, models 254 closer to the mean field model (i.e., with uniform connectivity) often do remarkably well 255 (see [37] for a social network perspective on this). However, such models generally do 256 not capture regional spread of human infections because of the complicated patterns of 257 human movement (the third wave of the 2009 influenza pandemic across the USA, 258 perhaps, being an unusually diffusive counterexample [7] ) . To elucidate these patterns, 259 many empirical studies have been performed and a variety of abstractions have been 260 proposed. The task of choosing among these abstractions for help in help predicting 261 spread of infectious disease is complicated by the fact that (i) model formulations may 262 differ with respect to how well they actually reproduce aggregate mobility patterns, and 263 (ii) model fit may be shaped by the manner in which mobility is filtered by transmission 264 and behavior.\\nTo advance the discussion of these issues, we considered a suite of candidate models 266 of spatial interactions and fit them to the pre-vaccination measles data from England cases. The gravity model-which has gained recent prominence in infectious disease As the gravity model has had a very rapid adoption in spatial disease epidemiology 284 during the last decade (though Noulas et al. [13] have noted the importance of 285 considering alternatives), we used this as a baseline. Despite its common usage it 286 significantly under-performs relative to the several other models. Combining SLiC and 287 LISA statistics we found that the greatest tension between the gravity model and the 288 preferred alternatives is in the Manchester-Liverpool-Leeds conurbation of northwestern 289 England, where many towns and villages commingle amongst several major cities. formulation) that spatial interaction, once discounted for higher-order interference, is 295 roughly proportional to the geometric mean of the community sizes. This curious 296 suggestion warrants future investigation.\\nIn this study we have used actual disease incidence data, as opposed to raw 298 measurments of human movement, to further our understanding of the principles 299 governing how human hosts spread ifectious disease across a populated landscape. We 300 have found both strong evidence of higher-order interactions among population centers, 301 and that candidate models differ significantly in their ability to capture the empirical 302 patterns. We hope our findings will help stimulate a systematic, data-driven discussion 303 of the relative merit of alternative predictive models for the probable path for spatial 304 spread of infectious disease. Clearly, the prospects are good for good for further 305 refinements and improved parameterizations. Spatial interaction models predict the flux of human movements between population centers (cities, towns, villages) as a function of the distribution of the population on the landscape. In this diagram, the relative magnitude of the fluxes from a focal town to other population centers are represented by the widths of the arrows. In the widely-employed gravity models (A), interactions among cities is strictly pairwise. Thus the addition of a new town (B) has no effect on the movement to other towns. In Fotheringham's competing destinations model (C), however, competition or synergy among nearby communities can reduce or augment fluxes. Stouffer's model of intervening opportunities and the radiation model (D) posit that movement from one city to another is diminished by the presence of opportunities in communities more proximal to the source city. author/funder.

Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': 'for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although 39 replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious 40 virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy. This is consistent with our 41 earlier report describing the presence of putative packaging signals in the PK region. 42 43 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The P2 64 and P3 regions encode the non-structural proteins 2B and 2C and 3A, 3B (1-3) (VPg), 3C pro and 4 structural protein-coding region is replaced by reporter genes, allow the study of genome 68 replication without the requirement for high containment (9, 10) ( figure 1A ).\\nThe FMDV 5′ UTR is the largest known picornavirus UTR, comprising approximately 1300 71 nucleotides and containing several highly structured regions. The first 360 nucleotides at the 5′ 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) .

Plasmid construction. 117 The FMDV replicon plasmids, pRep-ptGFP, and the replication-defective polymerase mutant 118 control, 3D-GNN, have already been described (10).\\nTo introduce mutations into the PK region, the pRep-ptGFP replicon plasmid was digested 121 with SpeI and KpnI and the resulting fragment inserted into a sub-cloning vector (pBluescript) 122 to create the pBluescript PK. PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using ΔPK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3′ end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using ΔPK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer.

As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.\\nChanging the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder.

The 5′ UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.\\nMoreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).\\nThe presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

       "      <td>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 , which by March 2020 has already spread across more than 80 countries 1 . Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia, often resulting in death 2 . Soon after the first epidemiological data together with SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were made available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries.\\nDespite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. In particular, the US-based NextStrain 3 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford, UK, among others. Recently, an editorial published on Science 6 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data.\\nHence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed.\\n.

We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences deposited on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population ( Figure 1 ). As March 10 th 2020, 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available, almost twice as much than just one week earlier (March 3 rd 2020, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries). Yet, the sampling per country was inhomogeneous, with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes (Spearman correlation = 0.03). Moreover, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country.\\nItaly, for example, the second country per confirmed cases, has uploaded so far only two genomes from Lombardy and three from Lazio (Table S1) , i.e. only two of the twenty Italian regions, all with confirmed cases 9 . China and USA contributed with 123 and 63 genomes respectively (56% combined), while 13 countries contribute with only one or two samples (6.3% combined). Notably, three countries with less than 400 confirmed cases have provided a substantial number of genomes (Netherlands 28, Australia 18, Singapore 11; 17% combined) ( Figure 1 ).\\nThe effect of inhomogeneous sampling and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions, like the ones recently rushed through news and (social) media to claim specific dissemination routes of SARS-CoV-2 among countries, can be quite dramatic. An instructive example is the putative introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy from Germany. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree, inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on March 3 rd , 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1 ), showed a well-supported cluster of European and Asian sequences (reported in Figure 2a ), which contained a subclade (subclade A, Figure 2a ) including a sequence isolated in Germany that .

However, in a new tree inferred just one week later, when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on GISAID 8 ( Figure S2 ), the direct link between Germany and Italy has disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from Portugal, Brazil, Wales and Netherland ( Figure 2b ). Most importantly, there is no sufficient evidence of a higher likelihood (Shimodaira-Hasgawa test, Table 1 ) for tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree (see arrows in Figure 2b) compared to the ML tree inferred from the real data. In other words, it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern (and, therefore, phylogeographic reconstruction)\\nis the most likely.\\nLack of resolution and uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected, considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic, even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving RNA virus. Plots of pairwise transitions/transversions vs. genetic distance 10 showed, indeed, low genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes, considerable scattering, and overlap in transitions and transversions among closely related sequences (Figure 3a ). The 331 full genomes available contained 477 out of 29,564 variable sites (1.6%), of which 377 were singleton and only 100 (0.34%) parsimony informative, indicating a substantial lack of phylogenetic information, and raising the possibility of a number of sequencing errors. Further assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11 , which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences (quartet), randomly .

Quartets are considered \"resolved\" when the three likelihoods are significantly different (phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e. data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include &lt;40% of the unresolved quartets 12 , way lower than the 52.9% unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment ( Figure 3b ). It is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any SARS-CoV-2 tree unreliable, and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution. Finally, the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ML tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal (no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time, Figure 3c ). This is, again, expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak. Bayesian analysis 13 , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate. With more genome sequences sampled from different time points and geographic areas made available, literally, every day, Bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option. However, as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable.\\nTaken together, our observations suggest that any conclusion drawn, at present, about existing lineages and direction of viral spread, based on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, is potentially misleading. Nowadays, published scientific data and media are very easily .

We believe that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Any inference based on phylogenetic trees should be considered at the very best preliminary, and hypothesis-generating.\\nHence the need for 1) avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and 2) continuing the concerted scientific effort to increase the number and quality of available data. The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread will unveil an unprecedented amount of information, which is essential to make policy decisions. The whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic, and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing. Some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant, high quality sequence data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases, such as Italy and South Korea, but also from others that seem to be experiencing, at least for now, a lower number of infections.\\nGISAID was accessed on March 3 rd and 10 th , 2020 (final dataset information reported in Table   S1 ). After quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides, the first dataset (March 3 rd 2020) consisted of 169 genomes from 22 countries, while the second (March 10 th , 2020) 331 from 29 countries. Confirmed cases were retrieved for the same day from interactive web-based dashboard developed by Johns Hopkins University 14 .\\nTransition/transversions vs. genetic distance plot were calculated using DAMBE6 10 .

Topology was tested performing the Shimodaira-Hasegawa 17 on \"Subclade A\" by comparing the inferred tree to three trees where two branches: (Tree 1) Italy (EPI_ISL_412973) switched with Wales (EPI_ISL_413555), (Tree 2) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862 with) Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 3) and Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648) with Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 4) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862) with Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648). All tests performed 10,000 resamplings using the using the RELL approximation method 18 .

       "      <td>The 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread across China and 24 other countries 1-3 as of February 8, 2020 . The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.\\nHealthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.\\nThis study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.\\nRecent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.\\nThe Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .\\nThe ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.\\nThe reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Metagenomic sequencing, which allows us to directly obtain total genomic DNAs from host-associated and environmental samples, has led to important findings in many areas, such as digestive health [1] . While bacteria are the main focus of most metagenomic sequencing projects, there are fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data with sequencing viruses as the main purpose [2] . There are different types of viruses. We are mainly concerned with RNA viruses because many RNA viruses are notorious human pathogens, such as Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, SARS-CoV, and recently identified 2019-nCoV causing Wuhan pneumonia. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. This high genetic diversity within and across different hosts poses a great challenge for designing long-term protection strategies against these infectious diseases. For example, as the circulating strains can change every year, flu vaccine has to be administered every year.\\nAdvances in viral metagenomics have contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. According to a survey by Woolhouse et. al, the number of newly identified RNA viruses is changing from 1,899 in 2005 to 5,561 in 2018, which is 3 times of increase [3] . Largescale RNA virus sequencing projects using nextgeneration sequencing technologies have been conducted for different species. For example, Shi et al. have discovered a large number of new RNA viruses by sequencing samples from invertebrate and vertebrate animals [4, 5] . Claire et al. have discovered 25 new RNA viruses by sequencing samples associated with different drosophilid [6] . Bolduc et al. sequenced RNA viruses from Archaeal and bacterial samples [7] . Given fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data and expected discovery of new viruses, a key step is to conduct composition analysis for these data and assign taxonomic groups for possibly new species.\\nComposition analysis can be conducted at the read level or contig level. There is no doubt that contigs can provide more information than short reads in taxonomic classification. However, metagenomic assembly is still one of the most challenging computational problems in bioinformatics. Unlike single genome assembly, metagenomic assembly is more likely to produce chimeric contigs that can contain regions from different species. Thus, metagenomic assembly is often preceded by read binning that groups reads with the same or similar taxonomic labels [8] in order to achieve better performance.\\nIn this work, we design a read level taxonomic classification tool (named as \"CHEER\") for labeling new species in viral metagenomic data. To detect known species with available reference genomes, alignment-based methods can provide sufficient information for both classification and abundance estimation. This function has been incorporated in existing pipelines [9, 10, 11] and is thus not the focus of our tool. Instead, our tool is designed to handle the challenging cases of assigning taxonomic labels for reads of new species, which have not been observed before. This problem was clearly formulated in metagenomic phylogenetic classification tools such as Phymm and PhymmBL [8] . We first define the classification problem following the formulation in Phymm: the classification problem is the assignment of a phylogenetic group label to each read in input data sets. As we are only interested in the hard case of classifying reads of new species, which have not been sequenced and thus no label exists for these species, the expected labels for these reads are the higher-rank taxonomic groups such as genus, family, or order. All our data and experiments are designed so that the test species are masked in the reference database and the trained models.\\nPrevious experiments have shown that nucleotide-level homology search is not sensitive enough for assigning higher rank taxonomic groups to reads from new species [9, 10] . Protein-based homology search is thus preferred for phylogenetic classification [11, 12] . In particular, a recent tool, VirusSeeker [13] utilized BLASTx to classify reads into bacteria, phages, and other viruses. It is not clear whether the protein homology search is able to generate accurate classification at lower ranks. We will evaluate this in our experiments.\\nThere are also alignment-free methods for phylogenetic classification. Many of those tools implemented different machine learning models and were mainly designed for bacteria. For example, RDP [14] adopted a Naïve Bayes based classifier that can automatically learn features from the reads and assigned taxonomic labels to sequences from bacterial and archaeal 16S genes and fungal 28S genes. The NBC classifier [15, 16] encoded metagenomic reads using k-mers and implemented a bag-of-word model to achieve the readlevel taxonomic classification. Phymm [8] utilized interpolated Markov models (IMMs) for metagenomic read classification. These learning-based models enable users to label reads originating from new species.\\nThe previous works have shown that sequence composition is still an important and informative feature for phylogenetic classification. Recent applications of deep learning models have achieved better performance than conventional machine learning methods in different sequence classification problems [17] . In particular, the convolution filters in Convolutional Neural Network models (CNN) can represent degenerated sequence motifs and thus help CNN models to learn abstract composition-based features. For example, frequently activated convolution filters learned by DeepFam often represented the conserved motifs in different protein domain families [18] . The successful applications of deep learning in sequence classification motivated us to design a novel deep learning-based classification model for assigning taxonomic groups for new species in viral metagenomic data.\\nOur main contributions are summarized below. First, our deep learning model can assign higher rank phylogenetic group labels (such as genus) for reads from new species. To achieve this goal, our model organizes multiple CNN-based classifiers in a tree for hierarchical taxonomic group assignment. Second, to enable our model to capture as much information as possible from short reads, we implemented and compared two encoding methods: one hot vs. embedding. Third, as viral metagenomic data usually contains contaminations from either the host genomes or other microbes, we formulated the pre-processing step as an open set problem in targeted image classification and rejected non-viral reads by choosing appropriate negative training sets. We tested our model on both simulated metagenomic data and also real sequencing data. The results show that our model competes favorably with other popular methods.\\nIn this section, we will introduce our method for viral metagenomic taxonomic classification. First, we will show the architecture of CHEER, which is a hierarchical classification model from order to genus. Second, classifiers at each level will be described. Third, we will introduce DNA sequence encoding using skipgram based word embedding and compare it with onehot encoding. Forth, we will describe the rejection layer, following the idea of the open set problem, which is adopted to filter reads not belonging to RNA viruses. Finally, we will detail our dataset used in training and validation.\\nThe architecture of our model is sketched in Fig. 1. The key component is a tree model that consists of multiple classifiers from order to genus. In order to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species, or even new genus, our classification is conducted using a top-down approach from the root to the leaf node. The top layer is a trained CNN that can reject reads not belonging to RNA viruses, which is an important preprocessing step for viral metagenomic data because of the contamination from the host genome or other microbes. Then, the filtered reads (i.e. mostly RNA viral reads) will be fed into the hierarchical classification model, which is referred to as the tree model hereafter. Specifically, the order-level classifier is responsible for classifying the reads into their originating orders. Then each order has a separately trained classifier for assigning input reads to families within that order (O1 to O3 in Fig. 1 ). For all the reads assigned into one family, the family classifier (F1-F7) will assign the reads to different genus within that family. As an example, a path for classifying a read from a species in genus 7 is highlighted in Fig. 1 . CHEER also implemented early stop functions at each level for stopping the classification path at higher ranks. This function can accommodate taxonomic classification for species from new genus or even higher ranks, which is possible for RNA viruses. It is convenient to add fine-grained classifiers within each genus so that we can assign species-level labels. However, as our focus is to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species that do not have a species labels in the training data, we did not include the species-level assignment in this work.\\nAlternative designs of hierarchical classification work, like [19, 20] , either build a classifier for each taxonomic rank or build a binary classifier for each class. We implemented a structure that built just one classifier for each taxonomic rank and compared different structures' performance. According to the result shown in [Supplementary file 1], the structure shown in Fig.1 is better than one classifier per rank. Although one classifier per rank requires fewer classifiers, it needs to train many more parameters because the number of labels for each classifier increases by times. As a result, we observe overfitting more frequently.\\nEach classifier in the tree model is implemented using CNN, which has achieved superior performance in various sequence classification problems [18] . The convolution filters used in CNN resemble positionspecific weight matrix of motifs in genomic sequences. Frequently activated convolution filters can represent well-conserved motifs among sequences in the same class. Thus, a large number of convolution filters will be used in our CNN in order to learn well-conserved sequence features in different classes. Deep CNNs in fields such as computer vision often have multiple convolution layers in order to obtain more abstract features from training images. Here, we use a wide convolution design rather than a deep one, following the idea in [18] . Fig. 2 shows the classifier with the default hyper-parameters. First, reads will be encoded in matrices as input to the convolution layer using two methods. We will describe and compare these two encoding methods later in the Section 2.3. Then, multiple convolution filters of different sizes are utilized to learn the conserved sequence features. According to our empirical study, we choose 3, 7, 11, 15 as the filter sizes, with 256 filters for each size respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Max pooling is then applied to each convolution filter's output so that only the highest convolution value is kept. After the max-pooling layer, we have a 256-dimentional vector as the output of each convolution layer. We concatenate these four vectors into one 1024-dimentional vector and feed it to one fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting. The CrossEntropyLoss function supplied by Pytorch is adopted as an error estimation function. Due to the unbalanced size of each training class, we use the reciprocal of the proportion of each class as their error weight to help the model fairly learn from each class. And we utilize Adam optimizer with a 0.001 learning rate to update the parameters. The model is trained on HPCC with the 2080Ti GPU unit. \\nIn previous deep learning-based sequence classification models [21, 22] , one hot encoding was commonly adopted to convert a sequence into a matrix, which will then be used as input to convolution layers. There also exist some methods using k-mer composition [23] and frequency [15, 16] to encode the DNA sequence, similar to the bag-of-words model in the field of natural language processing. However, these k-mers representation cannot give complete sequential information about the original reads.\\nTo incorporate both the k-mer composition and also their ordering information, we build a Skip-Gram [24] based embedding layer that can learn which k-mers tend to occur close to each other. Embedding is widely used in natural language processing to learn the semantic and syntactic relationships from sentences. A neural network with one hidden layer is trained to map a word to an n-dimensional vector so that the words that usually occur together will be closer in the n-dimension space. For our DNA read classification task, k-mers are the words and the embedding layer will map proximate kmers into vectors of high similarity. The main hyper-parameter when training the skip-gram model is the size of the training context m, which defines the maximum context location at which the furthest k-mer is taken for training. Specifically, for a kmer at position i as the input to the skip-gram model, the output k-mers are its neighbors located at i+jk, where −m ≤ ≤ m. Larger m results in more training samples with a cost of training time. In our model, the default value of m is 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , we will sample 3 k-mers as our dataset at a time with the middle one as the input and the surrounding two as the output.\\nAs proven in [24] , Skip-Gram is able to automatically learn the relationship between proximate words and thus is expected to help learn the order between k-mers in genomic data. We implemented a hidden layer with 100 hidden units shown in Fig. 3 . After training the model, the co-occurrence features are embedded in the output of the hidden layer. Thus, a k-mer in a read will be represented as a 100-dimension vector, where each element in the vector is the output of the hidden unit in the hidden layer.\\nWhen we use this pre-trained embedding layer to encode the reads, we first split each read into sequential k-mers. Second, each k-mer is fed to the embedding layer and the output is a 100-dimension vector. Third, all these vectors are combined into a large matrix according to the original position of each k-mers. Finally, this matrix will be fed to the convolutional layer.\\nBased on our large-scale experiments, we found that classifiers are easy to overfit with increase of k. Thus, we choose 100-dimensional feature vectors with k being 3 as our default embedding layer parameter set based on our empirical analysis.\\nDue to the small genome size and limitations in library construction, it is not rare that many viral metagenomic datasets are still contaminated with the genomes of the host and other microbes. Viral read screening is thus a key pre-processing step before the downstream composition analysis. Specifically, our tree model should only be applied to viral reads. However, the close set nature of the classifier forces it to assign a known label to each input without being able to distinguish viral reads from others. In this work, we will reject non-viral reads by formulating it as an open set problem in targeted image classification [25] .\\nIn a majority of neural network models [26, 27] , the logit of the last layer will be fed into the SoftMax function, which takes a vector of n real numbers as input and output a normalized probability vector for all labels/classes. However, for an irrelevant input from an unknown clade, all classes in the model tend to have low probabilities and thus applying a threshold on uncertainty can be used to reject unknown classes [25] . Along with this idea, serval approaches [28, 29] have been proposed to solve the open set problem.\\nIn this work, we incorporate the pre-processing step in our hierarchical classification model by integrating a trained CNN and a SoftMax threshold. Contaminations such as bacteria will be rejected using empirically chosen SoftMax threshold τ. Our experiments show that SoftMax outputs a nearly uniform probability distribution of all labels if the input is not relevant. Thus, the SoftMax threshold τ is used to reject reads not belonging to either DNA or RNA viruses. However, using this thresholding method is not able to distinguish DNA viral reads from RNA viral reads due to their similar sequence composition. To accommodate this challenge, we designed a rejection classifier in the top layer using DNA viral reads as the negative class in the training (see Fig. 1 ).\\nAs the focus of our work is to assign labels for new species, the hierarchical classification ends at genuslevel assignment, which is conducted by the bottom layer in Fig. 1 . Given the fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data, there are cases where a new species does not belong to any existing genus and thus the label assignment should stop at the higher ranks. Thus, we allow our model to stop at a higher rank in the tree during the top-down classification. Towards this goal, we still apply SoftMax threshold in our early stop function, which stops reads from further classification by the child classifiers. This early stop function also serves as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications if the confidence is low. For example, when a read arrives, the model may be able to identify its order and family labels with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. In this case, the model should only assign order and family label to this read rather than classifying it into a potentially wrong genus. To achieve this goal, SoftMax threshold is applied for every classifier in the tree. Only reads with a score higher than the threshold will be assigned to the child class.\\nAn example of early stop is highlighted by the yellow path in Fig. 1 . The model can classify the read into order 2 (O2) and then family 4 (F4) with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to.\\nAll the viruses used in the experiments were obtained from the RefSeq in the NCBI virus database. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009001 doi: bioRxiv preprint viruses' taxonomic classification was downloaded from Virus Taxonomy 2018b Release [30] published by the International Committee on Taxonomic of Virus (ICVT). Because training deep learning classifiers required enough samples, we removed the orders with only one family, families with only one genus, and genera with less than 3 species from our dataset. Finally, there are 6 orders, 23 families, and 55 genera remained. The RefSeq genomes are available at the following URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/fi nd-data/virus. The information of the taxa can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. As CHEER conducts read-level taxonomic classification, the training is also conducted using reads. In order to train our model on each complete virus genome, we generated simulated reads by uniformly extracting substrings of 250 bp with 200bp overlaps. All these reads formed the training set so that the model can learn the features from the whole genome. The validation set, however, is generated by read simulation tool WgSim [31] with specified error rate so that we can have a better estimation of the model's performance on real sequencing data. Some existing deep learning tools for taxonomic classification, like [21, 23] , generate reads first, then randomly choose some of them as training set and others as testing set. This strategy cannot guarantee that the training and testing data sets have no overlaps from the same species. In order to test whether our model can learn the label of new species, we use test species masking in the training set. Specifically, we split our RNA virus database into two independent sets. For any test species, their reads are not used in the training data. Thus, the model will only use the knowledge of known species for the new species classification.\\nIn this section, we will first give details of the hyperparameters of CHEER. Then we present the results of applying CHEER to both simulated and mock sequencing data. For the simulated data by WgSim, we evaluated how sequencing error rate affects the performance of CHEER and compared the taxonomic classification results with state-of-the-art. For the mock data, we tested CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and its ability in distinguishing viral reads from others.\\nIn our experiments, the minimum number of species within a genus is 3. We thus constructed three test sets, each containing reads from one species that is randomly chosen from each genus. The three test sets contain three different species, respectively. In total, 165 species from 55 genera are chosen to be \"new\" species for testing and the information of these species can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nWe used WgSim to simulate reads from testing species. In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing error on CHEER, we simulated reads with an error rate of 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively. For each classifier (CNN), we computed the classification accuracy, which is defined in equation (1). To ensure that the computation of the accuracy is not affected by the number of reads from different species, we constructed a balanced test read set by simulating the same number of reads for each test species (1,000 reads for each). (1) For each component classifier in the tree model, we record the average accuracy for multiple test species. For each taxa level, we calculate the average accuracy of all the classifiers in the same level.\\nWe present the results of CHEER at each level in this section. Because CHEER is designed for new species, we benchmark it against alignment-free models. Based on the results shown by Wood et al. [7] , Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) outperformed other alignment-free models. Thus, we compared the performance of CHEER and NBC. NBC in [14] was designed for bacteria taxonomic classification and thus, we retrained NBC on our RNA virus dataset. We implemented the NBC model following [14] with the same parameters. Since each family has a separately trained classifier, which conducts genus classification within that family, there are totally 14 classifiers at this level. Fig. 5 shows the accuracy for labeling families. There are totally 6 classifiers that assign reads to families within each of the 6 orders. Fig. 6 shows the mean accuracy at each rank. The family and genus level accuracy are the average accuracy of all classifiers in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . There is only one classifier for order level classification.\\nAs shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 , CHEER has better performance than NBC across different ranks. We also compared the performance of using one-hot encoding and embedding layer in CHEER. The performance comparison at each rank shows that for most of the classifiers, the embedding layer improves the learning ability. Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 also revealed the robustness of CHEER. Although the classification accuracy decreases as the error rate increases, the decrease is smaller than 2%. The accuracy is almost identical for many classifiers. Thus, CHEER is not very sensitive to sequencing errors. We also conducted experiments for reads with higher error rates (0.02 and 0.05). The results can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nThe next experiment is to evaluate our model on a real sequencing dataset and test CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and non-viral read rejection. We built a mock dataset by mixing Ebolavirus reads with gut bacterial reads from a gut amplicon sequencing dataset, which is chosen to ensure that we only use reads from bacteria. The taxonomic classification of Zaire Ebolavirus in the tree model is highlighted in Fig. 7 . We chose one of the Ebola species named Zaire Ebolavirus as our testing species because it is the most dangerous of the five Ebolavirus species and was responsible for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We downloaded the dataset from NCBI with accession number SRR1930021. These reads were sequenced by Illumina using whole-genome amplification strategy. Since Zaire Ebolavirus usually causes fatal hemorrhagic fever and abdominal pain, it is possible that this Ebola virus occurs with other gut bacteria. Thus, we created a mock viral metagenomic data by mixing these Ebola reads with a gut bacteria amplicon sequencing data in order to test whether CHEER can reject the bacterial reads at the top rejection layer. The gut bacteria dataset is downloaded from NCBI with accession number: SRR10714026. There are totally 2,737 Ebola virus reads and 51,280 gut bacterial reads in the mock data. After the rejection layer, the Ebola reads will be used to evaluate our tree model.\\nTo treat Zaire Ebolavirus as a \"new\" species, we removed its genome from our training set and re-trained the whole pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7 , after removing this species, we still have four Ebola species in our training set. However, our read mapping experiment using Bowtie2 [32] showed that none of the reads from Zaire Ebolavirus can be mapped to other Ebola species with the default parameters, indicating that using usual alignment-based methods will have difficulty to conduct genus-level assignment.\\nIn our work, CHEER will first use rejection layer to remove the reads not belonging to the RNA virus. Second, the \"Order classifier\" will be applied to evaluate how many reads can be classified into Mononegavirales order. Third, \"Mononegavirales classifier\" takes all these Mononegavirales reads as input to predict how many reads will be assigned to the Filoviridae family. Finally, \"Filoviridae classifier\" is adopted to check how many reads belong to the Ebola genus. Fig. 8 show the ROC curve of the rejection layer. True positive rate reveals how many Ebolavirus reads pass the rejection layer. The false positive rate reveals how many gut bacterial reads pass the rejection layer. We generated thresholds from 0 to 1 with step size 0.01 and used each threshold for the rejection layer. Then for each threshold, we recorded the true positive rate and false positive rate for plotting the ROC curve. As shown in Fig. 8 , with the increase of the threshold, more bacterial reads are filtered by the rejection layer, at the expense of missing more real Ebola reads. The default threshold for the rejection layer is 0.6 in CHEER. User can adjust the threshold according to their needs.\\nAfter evaluating the rejection layer, we continued to test the hierarchical classification performance at each rank. We first compared our tree model with NBC. Then we also benchmarked CHEER with the method using protein-level alignment in Section 3.3.3. The performance of the complete hierarchical classification pipeline of NBC and CHEER is shown in Fig. 9 . From order to genus, each bar shows the accuracy of correctly classified reads by the parent classifier. For example, NBC correctly classified 1580 at the order level. Then, 1564 out of the 1580 reads are correctly labeled at the family level. While Fig. 4 , 5, and 6 have shown the performance of CHEER and NBC at each taxonomic rank using the same set of reads as input for each level of classifiers, this experiment focused on comparing the hierarchical classification pipeline using only correctly predicted reads by the parent classifier. The results demonstrated that CHEER can classify Ebola reads with better performance. NBC can only classify 1,564 (57.1%) reads into Ebolavirus. CHEER, however, had totally 2407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly.\\nAlthough nucleotide-level alignment models are not ideal choices for predicting new species, as mentioned in [8] , protein-level alignment such as BLASTx is still frequently used for homology search because of the conservation among homologous protein sequences. We followed VirusSeeker [10] , which is a BLASTx based model, to align translated reads to virus-only protein database (VIRUSDB NR) provided by NCBI. Then, we kept alignments with E-value cutoff 0.001, which is used in VirusSeeker. The output of BLASTx shows that a read can often align to multiple proteins, making the phylogenetic classification ambiguous (see Fig. 11 ). Also, existing tools such as VirusSeeker often use the best alignment only, which does not always yield the highest accuracy. To optimize the usage of the alignment-based method, we implemented k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm to record the best k alignments rather than only using the best one. The label of the input read is determined by the majority vote in the labels of the top k alignments. According to Fig. 10 , most of the reads have hit numbers between 11 to 15 and 6 to10. Thus, we chose 1, 5, 10, 15 as our k when running kNN. There are also 512 reads that cannot be aligned with any VIRUSDB protein sequence. All these reads will be regarded as wrong prediction. Fig. 11 shows the classification results of kNN. When we use the best hit as the prediction the accuracy is only 64%. The best performance of kNN will be 74% with 2,026 correct predictions when k is 5. But the accuracy sharply decreases if k is larger than 5. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 also revealed that it is hard for users to choose a proper k in real classification tasks. The most common value of the hit number is 11-15 shown in Fig. 11 . The best kNN result, however, has a k equal to 5. Thus, comparing to this alignment-based method, CHEER, with 2,407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly, is more practical and reliable.\\nThe two main purposes of the early stop function are: 1) to handle the cases of a new species from an unseen genus or higher ranks; 2) to serve as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications in child classifiers. As Fig. 6 shows, the higher rank classification tends to be more accurate than lower ranks. Because the genus of Ebolavirus exists in our classification tree, the evaluation of the early stop function focuses on the second purpose. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of how many reads are classified into Ebolavirus genus correctly for different classifiers. By allowing early stop, the number of wrong predictions decreased sharply. In short, although there are fewer reads being labelled at the genus level, the total number of reads with wrong classification is decreased. Thus, this is still a useful feature provided by CHEER.\\nAnother significant advantage of CHEER is the high classification speed. Although training the model uses heavy computing resources, the inference procedure of this algorithm is fast. And with the help of GPU acceleration, the training time also decreases a lot.\\nIn the experiments shown in Section 3.4, it takes around 46 minutes to run BLASTx against the virus protein database. Our method, however, only takes 7 second for the preprocessing step to convert the raw sequence into a vector, and then takes less than 35 second to make the prediction for all 2,737 reads.\\nIn this work, all training data are RNA virus genomes downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq database. The training reads are extracted uniformly from the genome to make sure that classifiers can learn the features from the whole genome. To evaluate the model on new species detection, all species in the test set are excluded from the training data. Error rates are also added to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results reveal that the model is tolerant to the sequencing error. In addition, a SoftMax threshold rejection layer is applied to filter reads from non-RNA viruses. The SoftMax threshold in each classifier will also help early stop classification with low confidence and thus decreases the wrong predication rate. We show a case study on real-world data to identify how this threshold will influence the rejection classifier and early stop function. The results show that CHEER competes favorably with state-of-the-art tools.\\n</td>\n",

Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection.

       "      <td>Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is one of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses worldwide. 8 Clinical signs of disease are diverse and include respiratory distress, severe ocular discharge, poor body weight gain, decreased egg production, flushing (renal disease), and occasionally mortality in chickens. 7 IB is often complicated by secondary bacterial (e.g., E. coli, Mycoplasma sp.) and viral infections (e.g., avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious laryngotracheitis virus). 43 Lack of cross protection among IBV serotypes is a challenge to controlling IB 15 ; therefore, control of IB relies heavily on serotype-specific live attenuated vaccines. 8 Collectively, the presence of multiple IBVs in a single sample, emergence of variant IBVs, and the high genetic diversity of IBV can complicate the diagnosis of IB and illustrate the need for enhanced diagnostics. 15 \\nClinical swab samples (n = 15) were obtained from samples submitted to the Poultry Diagnostic &amp; Research Center, University of Georgia.

Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI C++ ToolKit), and each isolate was assigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus Gammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST databases were compiled using default settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was All rights reserved.

The All-IBV database was used to assign IBV isolates taxonomic ID to each of IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters.\\nThe IBV-lineage-typing database, which contains only one sequence per lineage, is required as centrifuge divides the score for any given read by the number of hits that have an equal score.\\nSince some lineages are overrepresented in GenBank (e.g., Mass strains), this results in the scores of those reads (e.g., Mass reads) being divided by a large number, effectively reducing the score for any single alignment. However, because there is only one read per lineage in the IBVlineage-typing database, it has insufficient diversity to determine if there is more than one strain of the same lineage present in a sample. Thus, the All-IBV database provides the diversity required for that analysis.\\nA schematic diagram of the workflow of MinION data analysis is presented in Fig. 1 . For Nanopore sequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for downstream analysis. Briefly, Nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using Albacore v 2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with following parameters (read_fast5_basecaller.py -i /Input_reads.fast5 --recursive -t 4 -s /Output_files --flowcell FLO-MIN107 --kit SQK-LSK108o fastq). Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for adapter trimming, (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default settings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides, representing the S1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq --extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_demultiplexed files.fastq). After barcode and adapter removal, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol, which includes Centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier 24 using the sequences in the above mentioned BLAST databases.\\nBriefly, basecalled reads (FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input.

These read clusters were used to interpret presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For isolate level identification of IBV, the lineage-based read clusters were individually aligned to the All-IBV database, which produced sub-clusters of reads. Each of these read sub-clusters potentially represents a different isolate and was further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high sequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data analysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore, these read sub-clusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software v11.1.3. (Biomatters, Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineagetyping database (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each sub-cluster.\\nA minimum threshold for number of reads per consensus sequence was not set as in two samples (sample #4 in Run1 and sample #12 in Run 2), only 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus sequences were built from all the available IBV reads per subcluster. The consensus sequences were compared to GenBank using BLASTn. To select the \"top hit\" from BLASTn output, sequence search results were ordered by \"sequence identity\" and then sequence alignments were evaluated for \"minimum mismatches\" and \"coverage\" of query or subject sequence. All isolates with the highest query or subject coverage and the fewest mismatches were used as \"top hit\" in the final results.\\nFor Sanger sequencing amplicons synthesis, cDNA from MinION library preparation was amplified using the following primer sets (Table 2) .

Secondly, a primer set based on GA98 sequence NCBI AF274439.1 was used to amplify Genotype IV-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Georgia 1998 and Delaware 072 serotypes). Primer sets were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST. 51 The PCR reaction mixture is composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 0.5 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 0.5 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× buffer, 0.5 µl of enzyme mix, and 0.5 µl of 10mM dNTPs, then made the final volume to 25 µl with nuclease-free water.

Samples with pathogenic IBV strains (Run 2, n = 5) were tested with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR and all five samples were IBV positive (Table 1) . Next, a GA08 serotype specific primer set (in house validated set of primers used for diagnostics) was used on all samples from Run 1 (including five samples that were previously tested by the pan-IBV PCR) and four of 10 samples were positive. Sample #3 and #4, which were positive with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay, were negative with GA08 specific RT-qPCR assay indicating that these samples contained IBV serotypes other than GA08 and required further testing. Sample #5 tested negative with both assays (Table 1) .\\nA total of 10 clinical swab samples (Run 1) were processed for Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of IBV lineages. Based on the MinION results, primers targeting GIV-L1 and GI-L1 (GA98 and Conn and primer sets, respectively) were created. The PCR products were cloned and multiple (6-24) clones from each sample were submitted for Sanger sequencing and results are summarized in Table 3 . Using GIV-L1 serotype primers showed that 9 out of 10 samples were positive with 1 sample (#5) negative for IBV (which is consistent with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR results for this sample). Consensus sequences from multiple clones obtained by using GIV-L1 primers showed the presence of GA98 (GA/A9dvaccinated) in 7 of 9 IBV-positive samples. DE072 was detected in samples #1 and #9 as the lone GIV-1 isolate but was also detected in three samples (#2, and #10) that also contained GA98 (Table 4 ).

Based on the two conventional RT-PCRs and the GA08 RT-qPCR, it was determined that only samples #8 and #9 contained a single IBV isolate, while the other 7 samples were positive for 2-4 types of IBV (Table 3) .\\nPCR amplicons obtained directly from 10 clinical swab samples with vaccine IBV serotypes were barcoded, pooled together and sequenced on MinION device (Run 1). A total of 38,661 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 42,940).\\nAfter demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 831 to 4114. A total of 14,845 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 128 reads were discarded due to middle adapters.\\nThe Nanopore reads were queried against IBV-lineage-typing database to determine if the samples contained IBV (Figure 1 ). This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in 8 of 10 samples.\\nThe number of IBV reads per sample (IBV positive sample) ranged from 56-944. The MinIONnegative samples included sample #5, which was consistently negative with RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays (and thus interpreted as IBV negative), and sample #1, which had the highest Cq values in the pan-IBV RT-qPCR (Table 1) .\\nSequencing data was further analyzed to determine if multiple IBV genotypes or lineages could be detected. Lineage-1 and lineage-27 from Genotype I (GI-L1, GI-L27), and lineage-1 from Genotype IV (GIV-L1) were the detected lineages in the samples. Results from individual RT-qPCR assay for GA08 (GI-L27), and RT-PCR assays for GIV-L1and GI-L1 confirmed the presence of multiple IBV genotypes and lineages in 6 of the 9 IBV-positive samples (#1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7) and AmpSeq results confirmed multiple genotypes and lineages in 4 (#2, #4, #6, #7) of those 6 samples (AmpSeq failed to detect any IBV in #1, and failed to detect GIV-L1 in #3).

High-quality consensus sequences were obtained from the other read clusters (&gt;5 reads per cluster). Each of the obtained consensus sequences were compared to GenBank databases using BLAST, which revealed &gt;99% sequence identity to respective IBV isolates Table 4 ). As described in the Sanger Sequencing section, two samples (#8 and #9) contained only one IBV isolate per the non-MinION assays, and the AmpSeq results were consistent with these findings. Non-MinION assays showed that seven samples contained two or more isolates per sample. Six samples (#1, #3, #4, #6, #7, and #10) contained two isolates per sample (Table 4 ). Of those six samples, AmpSeq detected both isolates in four samples (#4, #6, #7, and #10), one isolate in one sample (#3), and no IBV in one sample (#1; as mentioned above, sample #1 was the sample with the highest Cq value). Of note, sample #10 contained two isolates from the same lineage and AmpSeq was able to identify both isolates within this sample.\\nFinally, the seventh multi-isolate sample (#2) contained four isolates per the non-MinION results, and the AmpSeq detected two of those four isolates. These data show that a co-infection of multiple IBV lineages existed in the above-mentioned samples but a single RT-qPCR, or Sanger sequencing of a single clone may not have detected these co-infecting IBV lineages and required multiple assays to detect all the IBV types. However, the AmpSeq protocol accurately detected multiple IBV lineages in 4 of 7 samples, with partial detection in two of the remaining three samples (Table 4 ).

A total of 146,540 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 156,000). After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 4,285 to 41,131. A total of 24,297 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 8,109 reads were discarded due to middle adapters in the basecalled reads.\\nReal-time analysis of MinION data, which was obtained within 10 minutes of the sequencing, was sufficient for detection of IBV. However, the sequencing data obtained from entire sequencing run was processed with the same protocol as described above. This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in all of the 5 tested samples using all basecalled reads. The number of IBV reads per sample ranged from 5-4,956. Additionally, the sequencing data analysis showed that the IBV reads belonged to GI-17 lineage and typed the isolate as DMV1639. After MinION sequencing results, these samples were later tested to confirm the presence of IBV variant by MDL_DMV1639 IBV variant specific RT-qPCR assay. All 5 samples were positive for IBV MDL_DMV1639 variant of IBV (Table 5) .\\nIn all of the samples where a matching IBV genotype/lineage was identified by both AmpSeq and Sanger sequencing, the AmpSeq data showed high concordance with Sanger sequencing data, In one sample (#4), only a single MinION read of GA98 was detected by All rights reserved.

Additionally, a sequence analysis workflow is described here. The workflow analysis is designed to deal with the multiple, highly similar sequences contained within GenBank that are due to numerous sequencing experiments of IBV (especially vaccine viruses). This protocol demonstrates the feasibility of real-time-based sequencing to provide isolate-level resolution of IBV directly from clinical swab samples, including samples that contain multiple isolates.\\nThe proper diagnosis of IBV as the cause of clinical respiratory disease is contingent on virus typing and differentiating live vaccine viruses from field strains. 11 Previously, it was reported that IBV genotypes correlate well with the serotypes of IBV 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV will be useful to diagnose vaccine and variant viruses in clinical samples. The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates. While mixed isolates were not 100% identified (0/2 in #1, 2/4 in #2, and ½ in #3) in three samples with the AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed isolates required several non-AmpSeq assays. Although, there is room for improving this new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used without egg culture. Thus, it is another tool for the detection of IBV, especially in cases when multiple isolates may be present or when genotyping is especially important.\\nOne area that is problematic for a test such as AmpSeq is to detect all the isolates that may be present. While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these All rights reserved.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.\\nFor example, cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In this study, samples (Run 1 = 10, Run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, real-time data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for typing of IBV isolates.\\nThe advent of real-time, in-house, third generation sequencing represents a transformative opportunity for diagnostic laboratories, by offering the ability to more fully characterize PCR reactions beyond confirming amplicon size (e.g., routine electrophoresis), Sanger sequencing RT-PCR products, or by confirming a partial sequence through probe hybridization (e.g., probe-based qPCR). However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as genotypes from single sample. Thus, the MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with the data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid diagnostic assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV diagnostics. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be, and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method in the age of molecular diagnostics.

Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': 'for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although 39 replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious 40 virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy. This is consistent with our 41 earlier report describing the presence of putative packaging signals in the PK region. 42 43 author/funder. All rights reserved.

       "1  [{'text': 'During the past three months, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over 100 thousand people worldwide, and causing enormous distress to economies and societies of affected countries. A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined all full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies. Our analysis clearly shows severe limitations in the present data, in light of which any finding should be considered, at the very best, preliminary and hypothesis-generating. Hence the need for avoiding stigmatization based on partial information, and for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}, {'text': '.

However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignmentbased and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools. The source code, scripts, and pre-trained parameters for CHEER are available via GitHub: https://github.com/KennthShang/CHEER.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}]

Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION.

The first 360 nucleotides at the 5′ 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) .

Although replicons and full-length genomes lacking PKs were 106 replication-competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one 107 PK copy. This is consistent with our earlier report describing the presence of putative 108 packaging signals in the PK region (22). 109 110 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Plasmid construction. 117 The FMDV replicon plasmids, pRep-ptGFP, and the replication-defective polymerase mutant 118 control, 3D-GNN, have already been described (10).\\nTo introduce mutations into the PK region, the pRep-ptGFP replicon plasmid was digested 121 with SpeI and KpnI and the resulting fragment inserted into a sub-cloning vector (pBluescript) 122 to create the pBluescript PK. PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using ΔPK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3′ end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using ΔPK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer. The modified PK sequences were removed from 130 the sub-cloning vectors and inserted into the pRep-ptGFP plasmid using NheI-HF and KpnI-131 HF.\\n132 133 author/funder. All rights reserved.

As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.\\nChanging the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder.

The 5′ UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.\\nMoreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).\\nThe presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

       "1  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 , which by March 2020 has already spread across more than 80 countries 1 . Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia, often resulting in death 2 . Soon after the first epidemiological data together with SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were made available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries.\\nDespite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. In particular, the US-based NextStrain 3 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford, UK, among others. Recently, an editorial published on Science 6 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data.\\nHence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed.\\n.

We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences deposited on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population ( Figure 1 ). As March 10 th 2020, 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available, almost twice as much than just one week earlier (March 3 rd 2020, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries). Yet, the sampling per country was inhomogeneous, with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes (Spearman correlation = 0.03). Moreover, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country.\\nItaly, for example, the second country per confirmed cases, has uploaded so far only two genomes from Lombardy and three from Lazio (Table S1) , i.e. only two of the twenty Italian regions, all with confirmed cases 9 . China and USA contributed with 123 and 63 genomes respectively (56% combined), while 13 countries contribute with only one or two samples (6.3% combined). Notably, three countries with less than 400 confirmed cases have provided a substantial number of genomes (Netherlands 28, Australia 18, Singapore 11; 17% combined) ( Figure 1 ).\\nThe effect of inhomogeneous sampling and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions, like the ones recently rushed through news and (social) media to claim specific dissemination routes of SARS-CoV-2 among countries, can be quite dramatic. An instructive example is the putative introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy from Germany. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree, inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on March 3 rd , 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1 ), showed a well-supported cluster of European and Asian sequences (reported in Figure 2a ), which contained a subclade (subclade A, Figure 2a ) including a sequence isolated in Germany that .

However, in a new tree inferred just one week later, when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on GISAID 8 ( Figure S2 ), the direct link between Germany and Italy has disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from Portugal, Brazil, Wales and Netherland ( Figure 2b ). Most importantly, there is no sufficient evidence of a higher likelihood (Shimodaira-Hasgawa test, Table 1 ) for tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree (see arrows in Figure 2b) compared to the ML tree inferred from the real data. In other words, it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern (and, therefore, phylogeographic reconstruction)\\nis the most likely.\\nLack of resolution and uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected, considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic, even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving RNA virus. Plots of pairwise transitions/transversions vs. genetic distance 10 showed, indeed, low genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes, considerable scattering, and overlap in transitions and transversions among closely related sequences (Figure 3a ). The 331 full genomes available contained 477 out of 29,564 variable sites (1.6%), of which 377 were singleton and only 100 (0.34%) parsimony informative, indicating a substantial lack of phylogenetic information, and raising the possibility of a number of sequencing errors. Further assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11 , which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences (quartet), randomly .

Quartets are considered \"resolved\" when the three likelihoods are significantly different (phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e. data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include <40% of the unresolved quartets 12 , way lower than the 52.9% unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment ( Figure 3b ). It is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any SARS-CoV-2 tree unreliable, and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution. Finally, the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ML tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal (no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time, Figure 3c ). This is, again, expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak. Bayesian analysis 13 , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate. With more genome sequences sampled from different time points and geographic areas made available, literally, every day, Bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option. However, as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable.\\nTaken together, our observations suggest that any conclusion drawn, at present, about existing lineages and direction of viral spread, based on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, is potentially misleading. Nowadays, published scientific data and media are very easily .

We believe that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Any inference based on phylogenetic trees should be considered at the very best preliminary, and hypothesis-generating.\\nHence the need for 1) avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and 2) continuing the concerted scientific effort to increase the number and quality of available data. The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread will unveil an unprecedented amount of information, which is essential to make policy decisions. The whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic, and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing. Some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant, high quality sequence data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases, such as Italy and South Korea, but also from others that seem to be experiencing, at least for now, a lower number of infections.\\nGISAID was accessed on March 3 rd and 10 th , 2020 (final dataset information reported in Table   S1 ). After quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides, the first dataset (March 3 rd 2020) consisted of 169 genomes from 22 countries, while the second (March 10 th , 2020) 331 from 29 countries. Confirmed cases were retrieved for the same day from interactive web-based dashboard developed by Johns Hopkins University 14 .\\nTransition/transversions vs. genetic distance plot were calculated using DAMBE6 10 .

ML tree reconstruction was performed in IQ-TREE based on the best-fit model chosen according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 15, 16 . Topology was tested performing the Shimodaira-Hasegawa 17 on \"Subclade A\" by comparing the inferred tree to three trees where two branches: (Tree 1) Italy (EPI_ISL_412973) switched with Wales (EPI_ISL_413555), (Tree 2) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862 with) Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 3) and Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648) with Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 4) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862) with Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648). All tests performed 10,000 resamplings using the using the RELL approximation method 18 . Position of these genomes within \"Subclade A\" is indicated in Figure 1 with an arrow.\\nExploration of temporal structure, i.e. presence of molecular clock in the data, was assessed by regression of divergence -root-to-tip genetic distance-against sampling time using TempEst 19 . In this case, absence of a linear trend indicates that the data does not contain temporal signal and that the data is not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models.\\nAncestral state reconstruction of full datasets reported in Figures S1 and S2 were based on the ML tree obtained with IQ-TREE and performed using TreeTime 20 . We choose to show the \"European subclade\" and \"Subclade A\" as cladograms in Figure 1 as there are no phylogenetic and temporal signals in the datasets: scaling phylogenies in time or nucleotide substitution in this case is misleading. .

       "2  The 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread across China and 24 other countries 1-3 as of February 8, 2020 . The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.\\nHealthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.\\nThis study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.\\nRecent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.\\nThe Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .\\nThe ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.\\nThe reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. \\n

       "3  Metagenomic sequencing, which allows us to directly obtain total genomic DNAs from host-associated and environmental samples, has led to important findings in many areas, such as digestive health [1] . While bacteria are the main focus of most metagenomic sequencing projects, there are fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data with sequencing viruses as the main purpose [2] . There are different types of viruses. We are mainly concerned with RNA viruses because many RNA viruses are notorious human pathogens, such as Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, SARS-CoV, and recently identified 2019-nCoV causing Wuhan pneumonia. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. This high genetic diversity within and across different hosts poses a great challenge for designing long-term protection strategies against these infectious diseases. For example, as the circulating strains can change every year, flu vaccine has to be administered every year.\\nAdvances in viral metagenomics have contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. According to a survey by Woolhouse et. al, the number of newly identified RNA viruses is changing from 1,899 in 2005 to 5,561 in 2018, which is 3 times of increase [3] . Largescale RNA virus sequencing projects using nextgeneration sequencing technologies have been conducted for different species. For example, Shi et al. have discovered a large number of new RNA viruses by sequencing samples from invertebrate and vertebrate animals [4, 5] . Claire et al. have discovered 25 new RNA viruses by sequencing samples associated with different drosophilid [6] . Bolduc et al. sequenced RNA viruses from Archaeal and bacterial samples [7] . Given fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data and expected discovery of new viruses, a key step is to conduct composition analysis for these data and assign taxonomic groups for possibly new species.\\nComposition analysis can be conducted at the read level or contig level. There is no doubt that contigs can provide more information than short reads in taxonomic classification. However, metagenomic assembly is still one of the most challenging computational problems in bioinformatics. Unlike single genome assembly, metagenomic assembly is more likely to produce chimeric contigs that can contain regions from different species. Thus, metagenomic assembly is often preceded by read binning that groups reads with the same or similar taxonomic labels [8] in order to achieve better performance.\\nIn this work, we design a read level taxonomic classification tool (named as \"CHEER\") for labeling new species in viral metagenomic data. To detect known species with available reference genomes, alignment-based methods can provide sufficient information for both classification and abundance estimation. This function has been incorporated in existing pipelines [9, 10, 11] and is thus not the focus of our tool. Instead, our tool is designed to handle the challenging cases of assigning taxonomic labels for reads of new species, which have not been observed before. This problem was clearly formulated in metagenomic phylogenetic classification tools such as Phymm and PhymmBL [8] . We first define the classification problem following the formulation in Phymm: the classification problem is the assignment of a phylogenetic group label to each read in input data sets. As we are only interested in the hard case of classifying reads of new species, which have not been sequenced and thus no label exists for these species, the expected labels for these reads are the higher-rank taxonomic groups such as genus, family, or order. All our data and experiments are designed so that the test species are masked in the reference database and the trained models.\\nPrevious experiments have shown that nucleotide-level homology search is not sensitive enough for assigning higher rank taxonomic groups to reads from new species [9, 10] . Protein-based homology search is thus preferred for phylogenetic classification [11, 12] . In particular, a recent tool, VirusSeeker [13] utilized BLASTx to classify reads into bacteria, phages, and other viruses. It is not clear whether the protein homology search is able to generate accurate classification at lower ranks. We will evaluate this in our experiments.\\nThere are also alignment-free methods for phylogenetic classification. Many of those tools implemented different machine learning models and were mainly designed for bacteria. For example, RDP [14] adopted a Naïve Bayes based classifier that can automatically learn features from the reads and assigned taxonomic labels to sequences from bacterial and archaeal 16S genes and fungal 28S genes. The NBC classifier [15, 16] encoded metagenomic reads using k-mers and implemented a bag-of-word model to achieve the readlevel taxonomic classification. Phymm [8] utilized interpolated Markov models (IMMs) for metagenomic read classification. These learning-based models enable users to label reads originating from new species.\\nThe previous works have shown that sequence composition is still an important and informative feature for phylogenetic classification. Recent applications of deep learning models have achieved better performance than conventional machine learning methods in different sequence classification problems [17] . In particular, the convolution filters in Convolutional Neural Network models (CNN) can represent degenerated sequence motifs and thus help CNN models to learn abstract composition-based features. For example, frequently activated convolution filters learned by DeepFam often represented the conserved motifs in different protein domain families [18] . The successful applications of deep learning in sequence classification motivated us to design a novel deep learning-based classification model for assigning taxonomic groups for new species in viral metagenomic data.\\nOur main contributions are summarized below. First, our deep learning model can assign higher rank phylogenetic group labels (such as genus) for reads from new species. To achieve this goal, our model organizes multiple CNN-based classifiers in a tree for hierarchical taxonomic group assignment. Second, to enable our model to capture as much information as possible from short reads, we implemented and compared two encoding methods: one hot vs. embedding. Third, as viral metagenomic data usually contains contaminations from either the host genomes or other microbes, we formulated the pre-processing step as an open set problem in targeted image classification and rejected non-viral reads by choosing appropriate negative training sets. We tested our model on both simulated metagenomic data and also real sequencing data. The results show that our model competes favorably with other popular methods.\\nIn this section, we will introduce our method for viral metagenomic taxonomic classification. First, we will show the architecture of CHEER, which is a hierarchical classification model from order to genus. Second, classifiers at each level will be described. Third, we will introduce DNA sequence encoding using skipgram based word embedding and compare it with onehot encoding. Forth, we will describe the rejection layer, following the idea of the open set problem, which is adopted to filter reads not belonging to RNA viruses. Finally, we will detail our dataset used in training and validation.\\nThe architecture of our model is sketched in Fig. 1. The key component is a tree model that consists of multiple classifiers from order to genus. In order to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species, or even new genus, our classification is conducted using a top-down approach from the root to the leaf node. The top layer is a trained CNN that can reject reads not belonging to RNA viruses, which is an important preprocessing step for viral metagenomic data because of the contamination from the host genome or other microbes. Then, the filtered reads (i.e. mostly RNA viral reads) will be fed into the hierarchical classification model, which is referred to as the tree model hereafter. Specifically, the order-level classifier is responsible for classifying the reads into their originating orders. Then each order has a separately trained classifier for assigning input reads to families within that order (O1 to O3 in Fig. 1 ). For all the reads assigned into one family, the family classifier (F1-F7) will assign the reads to different genus within that family. As an example, a path for classifying a read from a species in genus 7 is highlighted in Fig. 1 . CHEER also implemented early stop functions at each level for stopping the classification path at higher ranks. This function can accommodate taxonomic classification for species from new genus or even higher ranks, which is possible for RNA viruses. It is convenient to add fine-grained classifiers within each genus so that we can assign species-level labels. However, as our focus is to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species that do not have a species labels in the training data, we did not include the species-level assignment in this work.\\nAlternative designs of hierarchical classification work, like [19, 20] , either build a classifier for each taxonomic rank or build a binary classifier for each class. We implemented a structure that built just one classifier for each taxonomic rank and compared different structures' performance. According to the result shown in [Supplementary file 1], the structure shown in Fig.1 is better than one classifier per rank. Although one classifier per rank requires fewer classifiers, it needs to train many more parameters because the number of labels for each classifier increases by times. As a result, we observe overfitting more frequently.\\nEach classifier in the tree model is implemented using CNN, which has achieved superior performance in various sequence classification problems [18] . The convolution filters used in CNN resemble positionspecific weight matrix of motifs in genomic sequences. Frequently activated convolution filters can represent well-conserved motifs among sequences in the same class. Thus, a large number of convolution filters will be used in our CNN in order to learn well-conserved sequence features in different classes. Deep CNNs in fields such as computer vision often have multiple convolution layers in order to obtain more abstract features from training images. Here, we use a wide convolution design rather than a deep one, following the idea in [18] . Fig. 2 shows the classifier with the default hyper-parameters. First, reads will be encoded in matrices as input to the convolution layer using two methods. We will describe and compare these two encoding methods later in the Section 2.3. Then, multiple convolution filters of different sizes are utilized to learn the conserved sequence features. According to our empirical study, we choose 3, 7, 11, 15 as the filter sizes, with 256 filters for each size respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Max pooling is then applied to each convolution filter's output so that only the highest convolution value is kept. After the max-pooling layer, we have a 256-dimentional vector as the output of each convolution layer. We concatenate these four vectors into one 1024-dimentional vector and feed it to one fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting. The CrossEntropyLoss function supplied by Pytorch is adopted as an error estimation function. Due to the unbalanced size of each training class, we use the reciprocal of the proportion of each class as their error weight to help the model fairly learn from each class. And we utilize Adam optimizer with a 0.001 learning rate to update the parameters. The model is trained on HPCC with the 2080Ti GPU unit. \\nIn previous deep learning-based sequence classification models [21, 22] , one hot encoding was commonly adopted to convert a sequence into a matrix, which will then be used as input to convolution layers. There also exist some methods using k-mer composition [23] and frequency [15, 16] to encode the DNA sequence, similar to the bag-of-words model in the field of natural language processing. However, these k-mers representation cannot give complete sequential information about the original reads.\\nTo incorporate both the k-mer composition and also their ordering information, we build a Skip-Gram [24] based embedding layer that can learn which k-mers tend to occur close to each other. Embedding is widely used in natural language processing to learn the semantic and syntactic relationships from sentences. A neural network with one hidden layer is trained to map a word to an n-dimensional vector so that the words that usually occur together will be closer in the n-dimension space. For our DNA read classification task, k-mers are the words and the embedding layer will map proximate kmers into vectors of high similarity. The main hyper-parameter when training the skip-gram model is the size of the training context m, which defines the maximum context location at which the furthest k-mer is taken for training. Specifically, for a kmer at position i as the input to the skip-gram model, the output k-mers are its neighbors located at i+jk, where −m ≤ ≤ m. Larger m results in more training samples with a cost of training time. In our model, the default value of m is 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , we will sample 3 k-mers as our dataset at a time with the middle one as the input and the surrounding two as the output.\\nAs proven in [24] , Skip-Gram is able to automatically learn the relationship between proximate words and thus is expected to help learn the order between k-mers in genomic data. We implemented a hidden layer with 100 hidden units shown in Fig. 3 . After training the model, the co-occurrence features are embedded in the output of the hidden layer. Thus, a k-mer in a read will be represented as a 100-dimension vector, where each element in the vector is the output of the hidden unit in the hidden layer.\\nWhen we use this pre-trained embedding layer to encode the reads, we first split each read into sequential k-mers. Second, each k-mer is fed to the embedding layer and the output is a 100-dimension vector. Third, all these vectors are combined into a large matrix according to the original position of each k-mers. Finally, this matrix will be fed to the convolutional layer.\\nBased on our large-scale experiments, we found that classifiers are easy to overfit with increase of k. Thus, we choose 100-dimensional feature vectors with k being 3 as our default embedding layer parameter set based on our empirical analysis.\\nDue to the small genome size and limitations in library construction, it is not rare that many viral metagenomic datasets are still contaminated with the genomes of the host and other microbes. Viral read screening is thus a key pre-processing step before the downstream composition analysis. Specifically, our tree model should only be applied to viral reads. However, the close set nature of the classifier forces it to assign a known label to each input without being able to distinguish viral reads from others. In this work, we will reject non-viral reads by formulating it as an open set problem in targeted image classification [25] .\\nIn a majority of neural network models [26, 27] , the logit of the last layer will be fed into the SoftMax function, which takes a vector of n real numbers as input and output a normalized probability vector for all labels/classes. However, for an irrelevant input from an unknown clade, all classes in the model tend to have low probabilities and thus applying a threshold on uncertainty can be used to reject unknown classes [25] . Along with this idea, serval approaches [28, 29] have been proposed to solve the open set problem.\\nIn this work, we incorporate the pre-processing step in our hierarchical classification model by integrating a trained CNN and a SoftMax threshold. Contaminations such as bacteria will be rejected using empirically chosen SoftMax threshold τ. Our experiments show that SoftMax outputs a nearly uniform probability distribution of all labels if the input is not relevant. Thus, the SoftMax threshold τ is used to reject reads not belonging to either DNA or RNA viruses. However, using this thresholding method is not able to distinguish DNA viral reads from RNA viral reads due to their similar sequence composition. To accommodate this challenge, we designed a rejection classifier in the top layer using DNA viral reads as the negative class in the training (see Fig. 1 ).\\nAs the focus of our work is to assign labels for new species, the hierarchical classification ends at genuslevel assignment, which is conducted by the bottom layer in Fig. 1 . Given the fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data, there are cases where a new species does not belong to any existing genus and thus the label assignment should stop at the higher ranks. Thus, we allow our model to stop at a higher rank in the tree during the top-down classification. Towards this goal, we still apply SoftMax threshold in our early stop function, which stops reads from further classification by the child classifiers. This early stop function also serves as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications if the confidence is low. For example, when a read arrives, the model may be able to identify its order and family labels with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. In this case, the model should only assign order and family label to this read rather than classifying it into a potentially wrong genus. To achieve this goal, SoftMax threshold is applied for every classifier in the tree. Only reads with a score higher than the threshold will be assigned to the child class.\\nAn example of early stop is highlighted by the yellow path in Fig. 1 . The model can classify the read into order 2 (O2) and then family 4 (F4) with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to.\\nAll the viruses used in the experiments were obtained from the RefSeq in the NCBI virus database. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009001 doi: bioRxiv preprint viruses' taxonomic classification was downloaded from Virus Taxonomy 2018b Release [30] published by the International Committee on Taxonomic of Virus (ICVT). Because training deep learning classifiers required enough samples, we removed the orders with only one family, families with only one genus, and genera with less than 3 species from our dataset. Finally, there are 6 orders, 23 families, and 55 genera remained. The RefSeq genomes are available at the following URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/fi nd-data/virus. The information of the taxa can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. As CHEER conducts read-level taxonomic classification, the training is also conducted using reads. In order to train our model on each complete virus genome, we generated simulated reads by uniformly extracting substrings of 250 bp with 200bp overlaps. All these reads formed the training set so that the model can learn the features from the whole genome. The validation set, however, is generated by read simulation tool WgSim [31] with specified error rate so that we can have a better estimation of the model's performance on real sequencing data. Some existing deep learning tools for taxonomic classification, like [21, 23] , generate reads first, then randomly choose some of them as training set and others as testing set. This strategy cannot guarantee that the training and testing data sets have no overlaps from the same species. In order to test whether our model can learn the label of new species, we use test species masking in the training set. Specifically, we split our RNA virus database into two independent sets. For any test species, their reads are not used in the training data. Thus, the model will only use the knowledge of known species for the new species classification.\\nIn this section, we will first give details of the hyperparameters of CHEER. Then we present the results of applying CHEER to both simulated and mock sequencing data. For the simulated data by WgSim, we evaluated how sequencing error rate affects the performance of CHEER and compared the taxonomic classification results with state-of-the-art. For the mock data, we tested CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and its ability in distinguishing viral reads from others.\\nIn our experiments, the minimum number of species within a genus is 3. We thus constructed three test sets, each containing reads from one species that is randomly chosen from each genus. The three test sets contain three different species, respectively. In total, 165 species from 55 genera are chosen to be \"new\" species for testing and the information of these species can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nWe used WgSim to simulate reads from testing species. In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing error on CHEER, we simulated reads with an error rate of 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively. For each classifier (CNN), we computed the classification accuracy, which is defined in equation (1). To ensure that the computation of the accuracy is not affected by the number of reads from different species, we constructed a balanced test read set by simulating the same number of reads for each test species (1,000 reads for each). (1) For each component classifier in the tree model, we record the average accuracy for multiple test species. For each taxa level, we calculate the average accuracy of all the classifiers in the same level.\\nWe present the results of CHEER at each level in this section. Because CHEER is designed for new species, we benchmark it against alignment-free models. Based on the results shown by Wood et al. [7] , Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) outperformed other alignment-free models. Thus, we compared the performance of CHEER and NBC. NBC in [14] was designed for bacteria taxonomic classification and thus, we retrained NBC on our RNA virus dataset. We implemented the NBC model following [14] with the same parameters. Since each family has a separately trained classifier, which conducts genus classification within that family, there are totally 14 classifiers at this level. Fig. 5 shows the accuracy for labeling families. There are totally 6 classifiers that assign reads to families within each of the 6 orders. Fig. 6 shows the mean accuracy at each rank. The family and genus level accuracy are the average accuracy of all classifiers in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . There is only one classifier for order level classification.\\nAs shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 , CHEER has better performance than NBC across different ranks. We also compared the performance of using one-hot encoding and embedding layer in CHEER. The performance comparison at each rank shows that for most of the classifiers, the embedding layer improves the learning ability. Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 also revealed the robustness of CHEER. Although the classification accuracy decreases as the error rate increases, the decrease is smaller than 2%. The accuracy is almost identical for many classifiers. Thus, CHEER is not very sensitive to sequencing errors. We also conducted experiments for reads with higher error rates (0.02 and 0.05). The results can be found in [Supplementary file 1].\\nThe next experiment is to evaluate our model on a real sequencing dataset and test CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and non-viral read rejection. We built a mock dataset by mixing Ebolavirus reads with gut bacterial reads from a gut amplicon sequencing dataset, which is chosen to ensure that we only use reads from bacteria. The taxonomic classification of Zaire Ebolavirus in the tree model is highlighted in Fig. 7 . We chose one of the Ebola species named Zaire Ebolavirus as our testing species because it is the most dangerous of the five Ebolavirus species and was responsible for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We downloaded the dataset from NCBI with accession number SRR1930021. These reads were sequenced by Illumina using whole-genome amplification strategy. Since Zaire Ebolavirus usually causes fatal hemorrhagic fever and abdominal pain, it is possible that this Ebola virus occurs with other gut bacteria. Thus, we created a mock viral metagenomic data by mixing these Ebola reads with a gut bacteria amplicon sequencing data in order to test whether CHEER can reject the bacterial reads at the top rejection layer. The gut bacteria dataset is downloaded from NCBI with accession number: SRR10714026. There are totally 2,737 Ebola virus reads and 51,280 gut bacterial reads in the mock data. After the rejection layer, the Ebola reads will be used to evaluate our tree model.\\nTo treat Zaire Ebolavirus as a \"new\" species, we removed its genome from our training set and re-trained the whole pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7 , after removing this species, we still have four Ebola species in our training set. However, our read mapping experiment using Bowtie2 [32] showed that none of the reads from Zaire Ebolavirus can be mapped to other Ebola species with the default parameters, indicating that using usual alignment-based methods will have difficulty to conduct genus-level assignment.\\nIn our work, CHEER will first use rejection layer to remove the reads not belonging to the RNA virus. Second, the \"Order classifier\" will be applied to evaluate how many reads can be classified into Mononegavirales order. Third, \"Mononegavirales classifier\" takes all these Mononegavirales reads as input to predict how many reads will be assigned to the Filoviridae family. Finally, \"Filoviridae classifier\" is adopted to check how many reads belong to the Ebola genus. Fig. 8 show the ROC curve of the rejection layer. True positive rate reveals how many Ebolavirus reads pass the rejection layer. The false positive rate reveals how many gut bacterial reads pass the rejection layer. We generated thresholds from 0 to 1 with step size 0.01 and used each threshold for the rejection layer. Then for each threshold, we recorded the true positive rate and false positive rate for plotting the ROC curve. As shown in Fig. 8 , with the increase of the threshold, more bacterial reads are filtered by the rejection layer, at the expense of missing more real Ebola reads. The default threshold for the rejection layer is 0.6 in CHEER. User can adjust the threshold according to their needs.\\nAfter evaluating the rejection layer, we continued to test the hierarchical classification performance at each rank. We first compared our tree model with NBC. Then we also benchmarked CHEER with the method using protein-level alignment in Section 3.3.3. The performance of the complete hierarchical classification pipeline of NBC and CHEER is shown in Fig. 9 . From order to genus, each bar shows the accuracy of correctly classified reads by the parent classifier. For example, NBC correctly classified 1580 at the order level. Then, 1564 out of the 1580 reads are correctly labeled at the family level. While Fig. 4 , 5, and 6 have shown the performance of CHEER and NBC at each taxonomic rank using the same set of reads as input for each level of classifiers, this experiment focused on comparing the hierarchical classification pipeline using only correctly predicted reads by the parent classifier. The results demonstrated that CHEER can classify Ebola reads with better performance. NBC can only classify 1,564 (57.1%) reads into Ebolavirus. CHEER, however, had totally 2407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly.\\nAlthough nucleotide-level alignment models are not ideal choices for predicting new species, as mentioned in [8] , protein-level alignment such as BLASTx is still frequently used for homology search because of the conservation among homologous protein sequences. We followed VirusSeeker [10] , which is a BLASTx based model, to align translated reads to virus-only protein database (VIRUSDB NR) provided by NCBI. Then, we kept alignments with E-value cutoff 0.001, which is used in VirusSeeker. The output of BLASTx shows that a read can often align to multiple proteins, making the phylogenetic classification ambiguous (see Fig. 11 ). Also, existing tools such as VirusSeeker often use the best alignment only, which does not always yield the highest accuracy. To optimize the usage of the alignment-based method, we implemented k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm to record the best k alignments rather than only using the best one. The label of the input read is determined by the majority vote in the labels of the top k alignments. According to Fig. 10 , most of the reads have hit numbers between 11 to 15 and 6 to10. Thus, we chose 1, 5, 10, 15 as our k when running kNN. There are also 512 reads that cannot be aligned with any VIRUSDB protein sequence. All these reads will be regarded as wrong prediction. Fig. 11 shows the classification results of kNN. When we use the best hit as the prediction the accuracy is only 64%. The best performance of kNN will be 74% with 2,026 correct predictions when k is 5. But the accuracy sharply decreases if k is larger than 5. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 also revealed that it is hard for users to choose a proper k in real classification tasks. The most common value of the hit number is 11-15 shown in Fig. 11 . The best kNN result, however, has a k equal to 5. Thus, comparing to this alignment-based method, CHEER, with 2,407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly, is more practical and reliable.\\nThe two main purposes of the early stop function are: 1) to handle the cases of a new species from an unseen genus or higher ranks; 2) to serve as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications in child classifiers. As Fig. 6 shows, the higher rank classification tends to be more accurate than lower ranks. Because the genus of Ebolavirus exists in our classification tree, the evaluation of the early stop function focuses on the second purpose. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of how many reads are classified into Ebolavirus genus correctly for different classifiers. By allowing early stop, the number of wrong predictions decreased sharply. In short, although there are fewer reads being labelled at the genus level, the total number of reads with wrong classification is decreased. Thus, this is still a useful feature provided by CHEER.\\nAnother significant advantage of CHEER is the high classification speed. Although training the model uses heavy computing resources, the inference procedure of this algorithm is fast. And with the help of GPU acceleration, the training time also decreases a lot.\\nIn the experiments shown in Section 3.4, it takes around 46 minutes to run BLASTx against the virus protein database. Our method, however, only takes 7 second for the preprocessing step to convert the raw sequence into a vector, and then takes less than 35 second to make the prediction for all 2,737 reads.\\nIn this work, all training data are RNA virus genomes downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq database. The training reads are extracted uniformly from the genome to make sure that classifiers can learn the features from the whole genome. To evaluate the model on new species detection, all species in the test set are excluded from the training data. Error rates are also added to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results reveal that the model is tolerant to the sequencing error. In addition, a SoftMax threshold rejection layer is applied to filter reads from non-RNA viruses. The SoftMax threshold in each classifier will also help early stop classification with low confidence and thus decreases the wrong predication rate. We show a case study on real-world data to identify how this threshold will influence the rejection classifier and early stop function. The results show that CHEER competes favorably with state-of-the-art tools.\\n   \n",
       "4  Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is one of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses worldwide. 8 Clinical signs of disease are diverse and include respiratory distress, severe ocular discharge, poor body weight gain, decreased egg production, flushing (renal disease), and occasionally mortality in chickens. 7 IB is often complicated by secondary bacterial (e.g., E. coli, Mycoplasma sp.) and viral infections (e.g., avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious laryngotracheitis virus). 43 Lack of cross protection among IBV serotypes is a challenge to controlling IB 15 ; therefore, control of IB relies heavily on serotype-specific live attenuated vaccines. 8 Collectively, the presence of multiple IBVs in a single sample, emergence of variant IBVs, and the high genetic diversity of IBV can complicate the diagnosis of IB and illustrate the need for enhanced diagnostics. 15 \\nClinical swab samples (n = 15) were obtained from samples submitted to the Poultry Diagnostic & Research Center, University of Georgia. Detailed information about the samples is provided in Table 1 .\\nTotal RNA was extracted from each of the swab samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions, aliquoted, and stored at −80 ºC until further use. These samples were previously tested for IBV and GA08 serotype of IBV.\\nBriefly, a pan IBV RT-qPCR assay 4 was used to detect IBV in general and then IBV strain specific RT-qPCR assay 36 was used to detect GA08 in the samples using the AgPath ID, One step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST following the previously described protocols.\\nFor MinION cDNA synthesis, RNA was extracted from 500 µl of each clinical sample using Trizol-LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), per manufacturer's directions.\\nA reaction mixture of 8 µl of total RNA, 1 µl of random primers and 1 µl of dNTPs was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, chilled on ice for at least 1 min followed by addition of 10 µl of cDNA synthesis mix including SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacture's instruction. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, then at 50 °C for 50 min for cDNA synthesis. The reaction was terminated at 85 °C for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. To remove residual RNA, the cDNA solution was incubated with RNase H at 37 °C for 20 min. All rights reserved.

Sequencing was allowed to continue for 2 hours until 42,940 reads were obtained for Run1 and 156,000 reads were obtained for Run 2 in 6 hours.\\nFirst, a lineage-typing database, containing 32 IBV S1 gene sequences (one sequence from each of 32 lineages in the 6 genotypes 44 ) and the chicken genome (GCF_000002315.4_Gallus_gallus-5.0), was constructed (referred to as \"IBV-lineage-typing database\" in this study). A second database was constructed with all the Avian Coronaviruses S1 sequences (n = 7328) available in NCBI (as of: 09-08-2017) and the chicken genome (referred to as \"All-IBV database\" in this study). Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI C++ ToolKit), and each isolate was assigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus Gammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST databases were compiled using default settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was All rights reserved.

The All-IBV database was used to assign IBV isolates taxonomic ID to each of IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters.\\nThe IBV-lineage-typing database, which contains only one sequence per lineage, is required as centrifuge divides the score for any given read by the number of hits that have an equal score.\\nSince some lineages are overrepresented in GenBank (e.g., Mass strains), this results in the scores of those reads (e.g., Mass reads) being divided by a large number, effectively reducing the score for any single alignment. However, because there is only one read per lineage in the IBVlineage-typing database, it has insufficient diversity to determine if there is more than one strain of the same lineage present in a sample. Thus, the All-IBV database provides the diversity required for that analysis.\\nA schematic diagram of the workflow of MinION data analysis is presented in Fig. 1 . For Nanopore sequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for downstream analysis. Briefly, Nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using Albacore v 2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with following parameters (read_fast5_basecaller.py -i /Input_reads.fast5 --recursive -t 4 -s /Output_files --flowcell FLO-MIN107 --kit SQK-LSK108o fastq). Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for adapter trimming, (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default settings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides, representing the S1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq --extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_demultiplexed files.fastq). After barcode and adapter removal, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol, which includes Centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier 24 using the sequences in the above mentioned BLAST databases.\\nBriefly, basecalled reads (FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint First, the basecalled reads were aligned to the IBV-lineage-typing database using BLASTn and reads were clustered based on the read sequence alignment to the respective prototype sequence of IBV lineage. These read clusters were used to interpret presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For isolate level identification of IBV, the lineage-based read clusters were individually aligned to the All-IBV database, which produced sub-clusters of reads. Each of these read sub-clusters potentially represents a different isolate and was further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high sequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data analysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore, these read sub-clusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software v11.1.3. (Biomatters, Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineagetyping database (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each sub-cluster.\\nA minimum threshold for number of reads per consensus sequence was not set as in two samples (sample #4 in Run1 and sample #12 in Run 2), only 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus sequences were built from all the available IBV reads per subcluster. The consensus sequences were compared to GenBank using BLASTn. To select the \"top hit\" from BLASTn output, sequence search results were ordered by \"sequence identity\" and then sequence alignments were evaluated for \"minimum mismatches\" and \"coverage\" of query or subject sequence. All isolates with the highest query or subject coverage and the fewest mismatches were used as \"top hit\" in the final results.\\nFor Sanger sequencing amplicons synthesis, cDNA from MinION library preparation was amplified using the following primer sets (Table 2) .

Samples with pathogenic IBV strains (Run 2, n = 5) were tested with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR and all five samples were IBV positive (Table 1) . Next, a GA08 serotype specific primer set (in house validated set of primers used for diagnostics) was used on all samples from Run 1 (including five samples that were previously tested by the pan-IBV PCR) and four of 10 samples were positive. Sample #3 and #4, which were positive with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay, were negative with GA08 specific RT-qPCR assay indicating that these samples contained IBV serotypes other than GA08 and required further testing. Sample #5 tested negative with both assays (Table 1) .\\nA total of 10 clinical swab samples (Run 1) were processed for Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of IBV lineages. Based on the MinION results, primers targeting GIV-L1 and GI-L1 (GA98 and Conn and primer sets, respectively) were created. The PCR products were cloned and multiple (6-24) clones from each sample were submitted for Sanger sequencing and results are summarized in Table 3 . Using GIV-L1 serotype primers showed that 9 out of 10 samples were positive with 1 sample (#5) negative for IBV (which is consistent with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR results for this sample). Consensus sequences from multiple clones obtained by using GIV-L1 primers showed the presence of GA98 (GA/A9dvaccinated) in 7 of 9 IBV-positive samples. DE072 was detected in samples #1 and #9 as the lone GIV-1 isolate but was also detected in three samples (#2, and #10) that also contained GA98 (Table 4 ).

Based on the two conventional RT-PCRs and the GA08 RT-qPCR, it was determined that only samples #8 and #9 contained a single IBV isolate, while the other 7 samples were positive for 2-4 types of IBV (Table 3) .\\nPCR amplicons obtained directly from 10 clinical swab samples with vaccine IBV serotypes were barcoded, pooled together and sequenced on MinION device (Run 1). A total of 38,661 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 42,940).\\nAfter demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 831 to 4114. A total of 14,845 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 128 reads were discarded due to middle adapters.\\nThe Nanopore reads were queried against IBV-lineage-typing database to determine if the samples contained IBV (Figure 1 ). This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in 8 of 10 samples.\\nThe number of IBV reads per sample (IBV positive sample) ranged from 56-944. The MinIONnegative samples included sample #5, which was consistently negative with RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays (and thus interpreted as IBV negative), and sample #1, which had the highest Cq values in the pan-IBV RT-qPCR (Table 1) .\\nSequencing data was further analyzed to determine if multiple IBV genotypes or lineages could be detected. Lineage-1 and lineage-27 from Genotype I (GI-L1, GI-L27), and lineage-1 from Genotype IV (GIV-L1) were the detected lineages in the samples. Results from individual RT-qPCR assay for GA08 (GI-L27), and RT-PCR assays for GIV-L1and GI-L1 confirmed the presence of multiple IBV genotypes and lineages in 6 of the 9 IBV-positive samples (#1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7) and AmpSeq results confirmed multiple genotypes and lineages in 4 (#2, #4, #6, #7) of those 6 samples (AmpSeq failed to detect any IBV in #1, and failed to detect GIV-L1 in #3).

High-quality consensus sequences were obtained from the other read clusters (>5 reads per cluster). Each of the obtained consensus sequences were compared to GenBank databases using BLAST, which revealed >99% sequence identity to respective IBV isolates Table 4 ). As described in the Sanger Sequencing section, two samples (#8 and #9) contained only one IBV isolate per the non-MinION assays, and the AmpSeq results were consistent with these findings. Non-MinION assays showed that seven samples contained two or more isolates per sample. Six samples (#1, #3, #4, #6, #7, and #10) contained two isolates per sample (Table 4 ). Of those six samples, AmpSeq detected both isolates in four samples (#4, #6, #7, and #10), one isolate in one sample (#3), and no IBV in one sample (#1; as mentioned above, sample #1 was the sample with the highest Cq value). Of note, sample #10 contained two isolates from the same lineage and AmpSeq was able to identify both isolates within this sample.\\nFinally, the seventh multi-isolate sample (#2) contained four isolates per the non-MinION results, and the AmpSeq detected two of those four isolates. These data show that a co-infection of multiple IBV lineages existed in the above-mentioned samples but a single RT-qPCR, or Sanger sequencing of a single clone may not have detected these co-infecting IBV lineages and required multiple assays to detect all the IBV types. However, the AmpSeq protocol accurately detected multiple IBV lineages in 4 of 7 samples, with partial detection in two of the remaining three samples (Table 4 ).

However, the sequencing data obtained from entire sequencing run was processed with the same protocol as described above. This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in all of the 5 tested samples using all basecalled reads. The number of IBV reads per sample ranged from 5-4,956. Additionally, the sequencing data analysis showed that the IBV reads belonged to GI-17 lineage and typed the isolate as DMV1639. After MinION sequencing results, these samples were later tested to confirm the presence of IBV variant by MDL_DMV1639 IBV variant specific RT-qPCR assay.

Additionally, a sequence analysis workflow is described here. The workflow analysis is designed to deal with the multiple, highly similar sequences contained within GenBank that are due to numerous sequencing experiments of IBV (especially vaccine viruses). This protocol demonstrates the feasibility of real-time-based sequencing to provide isolate-level resolution of IBV directly from clinical swab samples, including samples that contain multiple isolates.\\nThe proper diagnosis of IBV as the cause of clinical respiratory disease is contingent on virus typing and differentiating live vaccine viruses from field strains. 11 Previously, it was reported that IBV genotypes correlate well with the serotypes of IBV 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV will be useful to diagnose vaccine and variant viruses in clinical samples. The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates. While mixed isolates were not 100% identified (0/2 in #1, 2/4 in #2, and ½ in #3) in three samples with the AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed isolates required several non-AmpSeq assays. Although, there is room for improving this new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used without egg culture. Thus, it is another tool for the detection of IBV, especially in cases when multiple isolates may be present or when genotyping is especially important.\\nOne area that is problematic for a test such as AmpSeq is to detect all the isolates that may be present. While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these All rights reserved.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.\\nFor example, cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In this study, samples (Run 1 = 10, Run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, real-time data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for typing of IBV isolates.\\nThe advent of real-time, in-house, third generation sequencing represents a transformative opportunity for diagnostic laboratories, by offering the ability to more fully characterize PCR reactions beyond confirming amplicon size (e.g., routine electrophoresis), Sanger sequencing RT-PCR products, or by confirming a partial sequence through probe hybridization (e.g., probe-based qPCR). However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as genotypes from single sample. Thus, the MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with the data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid diagnostic assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV diagnostics. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be, and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method in the age of molecular diagnostics.
